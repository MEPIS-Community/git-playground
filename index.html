<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Welcome to the world of Linux and MEPIS. If you have just booted the MEPIS Linux LiveCD, you have the opportunity to explore some of the
features of a whole new computer operating system before you decide to install it! Exploration, evaluation, comparison. . .decision. So far
you have taken the first solid step toward a better computing experience, so enjoy exploring MEPIS Linux 8.0!</p>
<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 is based on Debian 5.0, codename &ldquo;Lenny,&rdquo; though the Kernel version is actually the newer 2.6.27. In view of stability and software availability, KDE 3.5x is provided as the desktop environment.</p>

<br />

<h4>A Note from The Developer of MEPIS</h4>
<p>Relax—you're among friends. The MEPIS community includes tens of thousands of people like you who want to work and play on 
their computer free of blank blue screens, viruses, and spyware&mdash;while paying only a fair and modest price for all of the software they need.</p>
<p>MEPIS Linux is intended to be easy to try, easy to install, and easy to use. This guide is meant to be your roadmap for getting
started with MEPIS Linux. We show you how to boot from CD, how to test drive MEPIS Linux, how to install on your hard drive, and how to start
using MEPIS Linux as a complete replacement for your current operating system.</p>

<p>You'll find lots of helpful people at the MEPIS forum sites listed in Section 11, along with many other resources to get you started.</p>

<p>If you are a developer, you have the freedom to remaster a customized version of MEPIS Linux. We have people who have done that.
In fact one of them did such a nice job of converting MEPIS Linux into a distro to use for old computers with low processing power and RAM by
today's standards, that we invited him to become a member of the official MEPIS family, with his <strong>antiX </strong>Operating System.</p>

<p>But it doesn't matter who you are. From computer professional to first-time computer user, we have tried to make an operating system for
you. . . for free. . .for whatever you need to accomplish.</p>
<p class="r"><strong>Good luck and have fun! <br />
&mdash; Warren</strong></p>

<h1 id="section01-1"> 1.1:&nbsp; About MEPIS Linux</h1>

<p>MEPIS Linux is a ready-to-use desktop operating system for PC  computers that have Intel or AMD processors with either 32 or 64 bit architecture and for Apple computers with Intel processors. It is designed to work side-by-side with Microsoft's Windows or Apple's Mac OS X in a dual-boot configuration, or to replace your old Operating System entirely. </p>
<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 comes in two different versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>MEPIS Linux 32</u> for 32-bit architecture
</li>
<li>
<u>MEPIS Linux 64</u> for 64-bit architecture
</li>
</ul>

<p>The 32-bit version will work for 64-bit architecture and may actually be better for many users, because they will have more software available and their installation may be more foolproof and reliable.  The only advantage of 64-bit is that it is faster for a few applications and possibly more on the cutting edge of technology.</p> 
<p>For system requirements and recommendations, please <a href="index.html#section03-1">consult Section 3.1.</a></p>

<p>MEPIS LLC and MEPIS Linux were founded by industry veteran Warren Woodford in November 2002 to create a user-friendly Linux version that &ldquo;just works&rdquo; based on Debian Linux. The first release was in May 2003.  In July 2006, MEPIS transitioned with the release of 6.0 from using Debian packages to using packages and repositories from Ubuntu 6.06LTS (&ldquo;Dapper Drake&rdquo;).</p>

<p>A major upgrade (6.5) came out in April 2007, introducing for the first time 64-bit and Mactel support. A few months
later, <em>anticapitalista</em>, a member of the European MEPIS community, released his well-received <strong>antiX</strong> based on a
MEPIS Linux core and optimized for old and low-spec computers. </p>

<p>In Version 7.0, released in December, 2007, MEPIS Linux switched its base to a combination of MEPIS packaged binaries, based on Debian and Ubuntu source code, combined with a Debian Stable OS core and extra packages from Debian package pools. As the developer explains: &ldquo;By using the latest
Debian and Ubuntu source code for building user applications, we can provide the best latest versions of the applications users want the
most. And by building on top of a Debian Stable core, we can provide a release that has the stability and long life that users
want.&rdquo; </p>

<p>MEPIS development continues to track Debian development, so that MEPIS 8.0 is being released as &ldquo;Lenny&rdquo; becomes the new Debian Stable 5.0.</p>

<h1 id="section02-1">2.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting MEPIS</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The MEPIS Linux <a href="index.html#s12-1_livecd" class="spterm"  title="An optical disk with a booting, usable operating
system" >LiveCD (or LiveDVD) </a> boots your computer right from the CD or other bootable medium without accessing the hard disk.  It copies a virtual filesystem into RAM that acts as the center of a temporary operating system for the computer. When you end your LiveCD session, everything about your
computer is back to the way it was, unchanged.</p> 
<p>This provides a number of benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>It enables you to run MEPIS Linux on your computer without installing it.</li>
<li>It allows you to determine whether MEPIS Linux is compatible with your hardware.</li>
<li>It helps you to get a feel for how MEPIS Linux works and to explore some of its features.</li>
<li>You can decide whether MEPIS Linux is what you want without permanently affecting your current system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Running from the LiveCD also has some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the entire system is operating from a combination of RAM and the CD, MEPIS Linux will run more slowly in a LiveCD
session than if it were installed on the hard drive. 
</li>
<li>Some unusual hardware that requires specialized drivers or custom configuration may not work in a LiveCD session where permanent 
files can't be installed.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s02-1_howtoget">How to get a MEPIS LiveCD</h2>

<p>If you don't have a copy of MEPIS Linux 8.0 on a CD or DVD already, here are the ways to obtain a copy.</p>


<h3>Buy From MEPIS</h3>
<p>The advantages of buying your LiveCD from MEPIS include ease of setup and &mdash;with a subscription&mdash; early access to upgrades and new versions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the latest version of MEPIS Linux on CD or DVD, shipped to you.</li>
<li>Pay a subscription fee at the MEPIS Store and download directly from our FTP server.</li>
</ol>
<p>MEPIS Store: <a href="http://www.mepis.org/store"> http://www.mepis.org/store</a></p>

<h3>Free Download</h3>
<p>You can download any testing or final release versions of MEPIS Linux for free from one of the public mirror sites listed on the page linked below.
Sometimes the mirrors are a bit behind the MEPIS Subscription download site, and some mirrors get out-of-date from time to time. If you can't find
a particular version at one site, it may be available at one of the other sites. Downloading the current MEPIS ISO via bit-torrent is also an option.</p>

<p>The LiveCD you download is actually an <strong>ISO:</strong> a disk image file in the  <a href="index.html#s12-1_iso" class="spterm"
id="iso" title="A file system for CD-ROM media readable by Unix, Windows and Mac OS">ISO 9660</a> file system format. Before trying to turn
it into a Mepis LiveCD, please consult Section 2.2.</p>
<p> If you use a free version of MEPIS Linux, please consider making a donation to support further development of MEPIS Linux.</p>

<h1 id="section02-2">2.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obtaining &amp; verifying the ISO</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page provides guidance if you intend to download an <a href="index.html#s12-1_iso" class="spterm"  title="Special format file that can be converted to a CD or DVD." >ISO</a> and burn your own CD or DVD instead of buying it from the Mepis Store.</p>

<h2>Downloading MEPIS Linux</h2>

<p>Here are a few considerations to keep in mind:</p>

<ul> <!--start main list-->
<li>The first day or two after new ISO is released, a particular mirror (a web site that is an exact copy of another site) may not
have it. Check other mirrors until you find the version you are looking for, then click the filename to download it. These files are usually
very large, so plan to wait for some time (depending on your machine, connection and web traffic).
</li>
<li>Sometimes an ISO may be incomplete. This is caused by the mirror attempting to grab the ISO before it has completely uploaded to their
source site. If this happens, the ISO may be unusually small or it may give <a href="index.html#s12-1_cloop" class="spterm" id="cloop" title="failure to read a block of compressed data"> cloop errors</a> when a CD is booted.
</li>
<li>If different mirrors offer ISOs of different sizes, the larger ISO is probably correct. If a mirror site has a bad ISO file, it will
probably be replaced during the next automatic update at that site, usually done once per day.
</li>
<li>Make sure to download the <strong>md5sum</strong>  file (see below) from the same directory as the ISO file. It will have the same filename but
the extension    will be <strong>.md5sum</strong>.  Make certain that you put the <a href="index.html#s12-1_md5sum" class="spterm"
id="md5sum" title="data verification tally"> MD5sum</a> file in the same directory as the ISO file.
</li>
<li>If the md5sum does not match, you could try one of the following options:

<ul><!-- sublist -->
<li>Copy the ISO with a bad checksum to a download folder used by a BitTorrent program (see Section 8.1), then restart the download
using a BitTorrent client program. Most BitTorrent clients will find the file already on your hard disk and patch it by downloading only the
missing or damaged portions.</li>
<li>Try a different mirror site.</li>
<li>Download the ISO again.</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist -->
</ul><!--end main list-->

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-2_bittorrent">Downloading MEPIS Linux  via  BitTorrent</h2>
<p><a href="index.html#s12-1_bittorrent" class="spterm" title="An Internet file-sharing protocol.">BitTorrent</a> file sharing (see also <a href="index.html#section08-01"> Section 8.1</a>) provides an internet protocol for efficient mass transfer of data. It decentralizes the transfer in such a way as to utilize good bandwidth connections and to minimize strain on low-bandwith connections. An added benefit is that most, if not all, BitTorrent clients perform error checking during the download process, so there is no need to do a separate md5sum check after your download is complete. It has already been done!
</p>

<p>The MEPIS Torrent Team also maintains a seeded bit-torrent swarm of the latest MEPIS Linux ISO, registered at
<a href="http://linuxtracker.org/">LinuxTracker</a> within 24 hours of its official release. Bit-torrent downloads may be somewhat slow following a major release. See: <a href="http://www.mepiscommunity.org/en/node/54 ">MEPIS Torrent Team Project.</a>
</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with BitTorrents, see the <a href="index.html#s02-2_links">Links and Guides</a> section for
sources of more information. </p>
<p>If you are downloading a MEPIS Linux ISO via BitTorrent, you can skip the next section about verifying the md5sum and go directly to <a href="index.html#section02-3">2.3:&nbsp;Burning the CD</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-2_verifying">Verifying the md5sum</h2>
<p>After you have downloaded an ISO, the next step is to check its md5sum against the official one. The md5sum is the result of a complex
calculation on the contents of a file: the outcome is a unique string. It will be identical to the official md5sum if your copy is
authentic. The following steps will let you verify the integrity of the downloaded ISO on any OS platform:
</p>

<h3>md5sum: Windows</h3>
<p>Windows users should download a tool called md5summer (link below):</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the self-extracting <strong>.exe</strong> file. Double-click it to put 2 files in the current directory:
<strong>md5summer.exe</strong> and <strong>md5summer.md5</strong>
</li>
<li>Run <strong>md5summer.exe</strong>, respond “yes” to associate extension <strong>.md5</strong> with md5summer program.
</li>
<li>Now you can either double-click on the <strong>.md5</strong> file and the program will check the md5 sum automatically, or from inside
the md5summer program you can select the location of the <strong>.ISO</strong> and <strong>.md5</strong> files, and then click
&ldquo;verify sums&rdquo; and select the <strong>.md5</strong> file you want to check.
</li>
</ol>

<h3>md5sum: Linux</h3>

<p><u>Method 1</u>. The easiest way to check an ISO's integrity in Linux is to use K3b, the CD/DVD burner that is installed with MEPIS
Linux 8.0.
When you first load an ISO file into K3b, it will automatically
calculate and display the <a href="index.html#s12-1_md5sum" class="spterm" title="data verification tally">md5sum.</a> You can be confident the download is valid if the final five
characters match those in the md5sum file you downloaded with the ISO.</p>

<p><u>Method 2</u>.  If not using K3b, open up a console/terminal and type:</p>
<pre>
cd /directoryname
</pre>
<p>where <em>directoryname</em> indicates the location of the ISO and md5sum files (usually <strong>/dev/cdrom</strong>). Then type:</p>
<pre>
md5sum filename.iso
</pre>

<p>Be sure to replace <em>filename</em> with the actual filename (type in the first couple of letters then hit Tab and it will be filled in automatically).</p>
<p>Compare the number obtained by this calculation with the md5sum file downloaded from official site. If they are identical, your copy is
identical to the official release.</p>

<h3>md5sum: Mac</h3>

<p>Mac users need to open up a console/terminal and change into the directory with the ISO and md5sum files. Then issue this command:
</p>
<pre>
md5 -c filename.md5sum
</pre>

<p>Be sure to replace <em>filename</em> with the actual filename (type in the first couple of letters then hit Tab and it will be filled in automatically).</p>

<h1 id="section02-3">2.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burning the CD</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Once you have successfully downloaded an ISO and verified its integrity, you are ready to create a LiveCD or DVD.</p>
<h2>General tips</h2>

<ol>
<li>Most important: <em>do not</em> burn the ISO onto a blank CD as if it were a data file!  An  <a href="index.html#s12-1_iso" class="spterm" title="Special format file that can be converted to a CD or DVD. ">ISO</a> is a formatted image of an entire CD. You need to choose <em>Burn disk image</em> or <em>Burn ISO</em> in the menu of your CD burning program. If you just drag and drop it into a file list and burn it as a regular file, you will <em>not</em> get a bootable LiveCD.
</li>
<li>Use the correct medium:
<ul>
<li>A good quality blank CD that specifies <em>700MB</em> or <em>80 minutes.</em> 
</li>
<li>A good quality DVD-5 with a 4.6 GB capacity.
</li>
<li>The developer of MEPIS Linux recommends blank CDs and DVDs manufactured by Taiyo Yuden as excellent quality at a reasonable price.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-3_burn">Burning the ISO</h2>
<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>The following method describes burning with K3b, the default application in MEPIS Linux,  but you can use any burner or the command line just as
well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the ISO and select <strong>Open with --> K3b</strong></li>

<li>Wait until the md5sum is calculated, then compare it with the one that you downloaded with the ISO: the md5sum  should match, otherwise it means you have a corrupted file.</li>

<li>Check <strong>verify written data</strong>. After the CD/DVD is written, K3b will read it and compare the result with the MD5 sum of the ISO.</li>
</ol>


<br />
<h3 id="s02-3_burnwindows">Windows</h3>
<p>If you already have a CD burning program installed on your computer such as Nero and EasyCD Creator (Roxio), go directly to Step 2.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install a CD or DVD Burner such as Cheetah (follow link below).</li>
<li>Put a blank medium in your drive.  Start the burner, and click <strong>Start</strong> and choose <strong>Burn ISO File</strong> (other wording may be used).  In Nero
and Roxio there is a similar command to Burn a Disk Image or ISO.
</li>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: the program names here are used as examples only, and no endorsement or guarantee is intended.</p>

<br />
<h3 id="s02-3_burnmac">Mac</h3>
<p>You probably already have Toast (Roxio) or a similar CD/DVD burning program installed. Just follow Step 2 above.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s02-3_verify">Verify the integrity</h2>
<p>It is a good idea to verify the integrity of the burn, just as you did of the ISO (in <a href="index.html#s02-2_verifying">Section 2:2</a>). If you didn't burn your new MEPIS Linux LiveCD/DVD with a
program that can verify the data after the burn, you can check its integrity another way.</p>

<br />

<h3>Linux</h3>
<p>In terminal type:</p>

<pre>
md5sum /dev/cdrom
</pre>

<p>Depending on your system you might need to replace <strong>cdrom</strong> with <strong>cdrom1</strong> or another device name like 
<strong>hdc</strong> or <strong>scd0</strong> (/dev/cdrom is the first CD drive, /dev/cdrom1 is the second one, etc.).  Check <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> to see the device
names on your system.</p>
<p>Wait for the MD5 sum to be calculated, and compare it with the sum obtained from the download site: they should be the same.</p>

<br />

<h3 id="s02-3_verifywindows">Windows</h3>
<ol>
<li>Get the free version of the Windows application <em>IsoBuster</em> from the link below.</li>
<li>Insert CD in drive.</li>
<li>Run IsoBuster as Administrator.</li>
<li>In registration dialog, select <strong>&ldquo;Free funct. only&rdquo;</strong>.</li>
<li>In left pane, right-click on CD (top line) to get context menu, and select: <strong>MD5 Checksum file --&gt; Create MD5 Checksum --&gt;  For image file with 2048 bytes/block.</strong></li>
<li>Compare the MD5 in the <strong>.tao</strong> line of the output with that of the downloaded ISO.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: the Windows program cited here is used as an example only, no endorsement or guarantee is intended.</p>
<br />

<h3 id="s02-3_verifymac">Mac</h3>
<p>When you select to verify the data in Toast or another burner, a byte-for-byte comparison with the ISO file will be carried out to check
the CD's integrity.</p>



<h2 id="s02-3_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you verified the md5sum of the ISO before you burned, but the CD-ROM you burned is no good:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try burning again at a slower speed.</li>
<li>Try another blank disk.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="section03-1">3.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System requirements</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following are minimum and recommended hardware requirements for installing MEPIS Linux 8.0. Keep in mind the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Minimum specifications are only what is <em>required</em> for install.  You will get poor performance from a system with minimum
specifications.
 </li>
 <li>Hard drive space directly correlates to the number of files you can store and additional programs you can install.
 </li>
 <li>More RAM will allow you to run more programs at once, and will make MEPIS Linux more responsive.
 </li>
 <li>You can expect MEPIS Linux 8.0 to perform approximately as fast as a clean install of Windows XP&#174; on the same hardware. Many users report a substantial increase in speed over Win-XP, but hardware varies.

<!-- ########################### SECTION 3.2 ########################### -->


<h1 id="section03-2">3.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coming from Windows&#174;</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you are going to install MEPIS Linux 8.0 as a replacement for Microsoft Windows&#174;, it is a good idea to consolidate and back up your
files and other data currently stored in Windows. Even if you are planning to dual-boot, you should make a backup of this data in case of
unforeseen problems during the install.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-2_backingup">Backing up files</h2>
<p>Locate all of your files, such as office documents, pictures, video,
or music:</p>

<ul>
<li>Typically, most of these are located in &ldquo;My Documents&rdquo;
folder (<strong>C:\Documents and Settings\Username\My Documents</strong> in Windows 2000, XP, and Vista, or <strong>C:\My Documents</strong>
in Windows 95, 98, and ME).
</li>
<li>Search from the Windows start menu for various types of files to make sure you have found and saved them all.
</li> 
<li>Once you have located all such files, burn them to a CD or DVD, or copy them to an external device such as a USB hard drive or second computer.
</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<!--PIM (email/calendar/contacts data-->
<h2 id="s03-2_personal">Backing up email, calendar, and contact data</h2>

<p>Depending on the email or calendar program you use, your email and calendar data may not be saved in an obvious location or under an
obvious file name. Most email or scheduling applications (such as Microsoft Outlook&#174;) are able to export this data in one or
more file formats. Consult your application's help documentation to find out how to export the data.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<u>Email data</u>: The safest format for email is plain text, and most mail programs support this feature. If you are using
<em>Outlook Express,</em> your mail is stored in either a .dbx or .mbx file, either of which can be imported into Thunderbird on MEPIS Linux 8.0. Use
the Windows search feature to locate this file and copy it to your backup. <em>Outlook</em> mail should be imported first into <em>Outlook Express</em> before being exported for use in MEPIS Linux 8.0.
</li>
<li>
<u>Calendar data</u>: MEPIS Linux's calendar software supports the iCalendar and vCalendar standards, so you should export your calendar
data to this format if you wish to use it in MEPIS Linux 8.0.
</li>
<li>
<u>Contact data</u>: MEPIS Linux's addressbook software is capable of importing many addressbook formats, but the most universal are CSV
(comma separated values) or vCard.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-2_winxpcd">Using Windows XP SP2 CD to create a backup</h2>
<p>If you have a copy of the original WinXP CD (SP2 only!), insert it into your drive when you're in Windows and when  the autorunner starts
choose <strong>Perform additional tasks --> Transfer Files and Settings</strong>, then <strong>Old computer</strong> to backup most of your
files and preferences for Windows-based programs to a file on your hard disk, which can then be burned to a CD or DVD for restoration later
if things go wrong.</p>
<p>NOTES: 1) The resulting file can grow to huge proportions. There is no option to split the file if it grows too big, so choose the option
to transfer only the settings and copy the remaining files you want to keep separately. 2) Do not rely on this method to backup email and
browser data for other programs than Microsoft's own.</p>

<!--Account information-->
<h2 id="s03-2_accounts">Accounts and passwords</h2>

<p>Although not usually stored in readable files that can be backed up, it's important to remember to make note of various account information
you may have saved in your computer. Your automatic log-in data for websites or services like your ISP will have to be entered in all over
again, so make sure to store off disk the information you need to access these services again. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<u>ISP login information</u> You will need at least your username and password for your internet service provider, and the phone number
to connect if you are on dial-up or ISDN. Other details might include a dial out number, dialing type (pulse or tone), and authentication
type (for dialup); IP address and subnet mask, DNS server, gateway IP address, DHCP server, VPI/VCI, MTU, Encapsulation type, or DHCP
settings (for various forms of broadband). If you are not sure what you need, consult your ISP.
</li>
<li>
<u>Wireless networking</u> You will need your passkey or passphrase, and network name.
</li>
<li>
<u>Web passwords</u> You will need your passwords to various web forums, online stores, or other secured sites.
</li>
<li>
<u>Email account details</u> You will need your username and password, and the addresses or URLs of the mail servers. You may also
need the authentication type. This information should be retrievable from the <strong>Account settings</strong> dialog of your email client.
</li>
<li>
<u>Instant messaging</u> Your username and password for your IM account(s), your &ldquo;buddy list,&rdquo; and depending on the service, the server
connection information may be necessary.
</li>
<li>
<u>Other</u> If you have a VPN connection (such as to your office), a proxy server, or other configured network service, make sure you find
out what information is necessary to reconfigure it in the event that you need to.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<!--Browser profiles / favorites-->
<h2 id="s03-2_browser">Browser favorites</h2>
<p>Web browser favorites (a.k.a. bookmarks) are often overlooked during a backup, and they are not usually stored in a conspicuous place.
Most browsers contain a utility to export your bookmarks to a file, which can then be imported into the web browser of your choice in
MEPIS Linux. Here are some export methods for common web browsers:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<u>Internet Explorer</u> Click <strong>File --&gt; import and export</strong>, select <strong>export favorites</strong>, select the <strong>favorites</strong> folder (to
export all favorites), select <strong>export to file or address</strong> and enter a filename for the favorites.
</li>
<li>
<u>Firefox 3</u> Click <strong>Bookmarks --&gt; Organize Bookmarks</strong>, highlight the bookmark folder to backup, click <strong>Import and Backup - Export HTML...</strong>,
enter a filename for the bookmarks.</li>
<li>
<u>Opera</u> Click <strong>File --&gt; import and export</strong>, choose <strong>export Opera bookmarks</strong> (if you plan to import them into Opera)
or <strong>export bookmarks as HTML</strong> (if you plan to import them into another browser), select the location for the favorites file.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<!--Software product keys-->
<h2 id="s03-2_licenses">Software licenses</h2>

<p>Many proprietary programs for Windows are not installable without a license key or CD key. Unless you are set on doing away with Windows
permanently, make sure you have a license key for any program that requires it. If you do decide to reinstall Windows (or if dual-boot
setup goes awry), you will be unable to reinstall these programs without the key.</p>
<p>If you cannot find the paper license that came with your product, you may be able to locate it in the Windows registry, or using
keyfinder software (example link below).</p>

<h2>Booting to the LiveCD</h2>
<p>Insert the disk into your CD or DVD drive and restart your computer.  You may need to set your system to boot from the CDROM first, see <a href="index.html#s03-3_troubleshooting ">Troubleshooting</a> below for details.</p>
<p>Once you have booted to the CD, you will be presented with a menu offering various choices; these are handled by a <a class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_bootloader " target="Program that initially chooses an operating system to load">bootloader</a> named GRUB that allows you to have several operating systems on your computer. The default boot choice should work for most  computers.</p>

<!--Testing compatibility for video, sound, and network-->
<h2 id="s03-3_test-hw">Testing hardware compatibility</h2>

<p>One of the best things about the LiveCD is that you can use it to  test your hardware's compatibility with MEPIS Linux without
installing it to your hard drive. Keep in mind that in general everything runs much more slowly from the LiveCD.</p>
<p>While booted to the LiveCD, make sure you test:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Sound</li>
<li>Network connection (particularly wireless)</li>
<li>Video (including 3D acceleration)</li>
<li>Peripherals such as printer, camera, MP3 player, or scanner.</li>
</ul> 
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>Some hardware may require the installation of drivers to work correctly;  although this is usually done after a hard drive install, it is possible
to use the boot option <strong>aufs</strong> which will allow you to temporarily install a driver (or other software) to your LiveCD
session. For details, see the link under Links and Guides.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s03-3_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><u>CD won't boot</u>.  If you have checked the integrity of your ISO, make sure your computer is set to boot to the CD drive. Newer  
computers often have a hotkey such as F8, F10, or F12 which will invoke  a <em>boot device menu</em> when pressed during startup. For older
machines,  you may need to edit your system's boot device order in the CMOS (BIOS)  settings. Please consult your system's operating manual
for the correct procedure.</p>

<p><u>LiveCD stops during boot</u>, or once booted performs  exceptionally poorly.  Try some of the Boot Options that can be found by clicking F1 on the opening screen (GRUB).  Problems with hardware, for instance, can often be overcome by entering <strong>noacpi</strong>, <strong>noapic</strong>, and/or <strong>nolapic</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="section03-4">3.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partitioning the hard drive</h1>

<!--Dual boot vs. single boot: when and what to partition, how much space-->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Before starting the install, you may wish to prepare the partitions on your hard drive to install MEPIS Linux 8.0. You can do this during installation, but it is recommended that you do it <u>before</u> starting the install. Note that some older hardware may require a restart after the partition tables are edited.</p>
<h2>About partitioning</h2>
<p>To prepare the hard drive for MEPIS Linux 8.0, it is recommended that you create three partitions: one for the root of the filesystem, one for the user home directories, and one for swap (virtual memory). You do not have to create a separate home, but it makes upgrades easier and protects against problems caused by users filling up the drive.</p>

<h3>How big should the partitions be?</h3>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Root partition: </strong>The minimum size for the root partition is 2.5 GB, however, this size will not allow you to install many programs, and may cause difficulty doing upgrades. Depending on how many programs you wish to install, you may want to allot between 5 and 10 GB.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Home partition: </strong>The home partition is where the documents and configuration data for all users is stored. Typically, you want to make this partition as large as possible, especially if you store a lot of pictures, music, or video data.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Swap partition: </strong>The swap partition is used by the operating system to store the contents of RAM when programs ask for more RAM than the system has. As such, while swap space should be analogous to the amount of RAM in the system, it becomes less necessary the more RAM you have. A good rule of thumb is to make the swap space double the size of your RAM, but no more than 1 GB (1024 MB).
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s03-4_hdd-names">Hard drive names in MEPIS Linux</h3>
<p>Before you begin editing partitions, it is critical that you understand how MEPIS Linux (and other Linux operating systems) refers
to hard drives and hard drive partitions.</p>

<p>Unlike Windows, which assigns a &ldquo;drive letter&rdquo; to each of your hard drive partitions, MEPIS Linux 8.0 assigns a short
<strong>device name</strong> to each hard drive or storage device on a system.  The device names always start with <strong>sd</strong> plus
a single letter.  For instance, the first drive on your system will be <strong>sda</strong>, the second <strong>sdb</strong>, etc. Within each drive every partition is referred to as a number appended to the device name. </p>
<p> Thus, for instance, &ldquo;sda1&rdquo; would be the first partition on the first hard drive, while &ldquo;sdb3&rdquo; would be the third
partition on the second drive.  It is important to understand the difference between referring to an entire device
(such as <strong>sda</strong>) and a partition on the device (such as <strong>sda1</strong>). </p>
<br />


<!--Prepping Windows for NTFS resizing-->
<h2 id="s03-4_ntfs">Resizing an NTFS partition</h2>
<p>Resizing an <a href="index.html#s12-1_ntfs" class="spterm"  title="click to go to the Glossary">  NTFS</a> (Windows NT File System) partition with GParted is generally a painless and simple procedure. However there are some small risks, particularly if your hard drive is old or very full. You can mitigate these risks by taking the following steps on your Windows installation (consult your online Windows help (F1) if you are unsure how to perform any of these tasks):</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Back up all your data, if you haven't already!</li>
<li>Run the disk cleanup wizard to delete unnecessary files. You may also want to run a third party cleanup tool (example link below). Make sure there is enough free space on the drive so that it will still have several gigabytes free after you resize it.
</li>
<li>Check the filesystem for errors using chkdsk.exe or scandisk.exe (depending on your version of Windows).</li>
<li>Defragment your hard drive.</li>
<li><u>If you are using Windows Vista</u>: Use the &ldquo;Disk Management&rdquo; tool in Windows to resize the drive. Be warned: this tool does not respect standard hard disk partitioning conventions and it will often leave a small unusable portion of the disk at the end point of the shrunken partition that will show up in the standards-based partitioning tools like those provided with MEPIS Linux.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h5 id="s03-4_steps">Resizing steps:</h5>
<!--Using -->
<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->

<ol>
<li> From the LiveCD click <strong>KMenu --> System --> Filesystem --> GParted</strong>.  NOTE: if for some reason GParted doesn't work right, you can try a similar program QTParted that's also installed, and <strong>cfdisk</strong> is a good command line utility.
</li>
<li>In GParted select the drive then select the partition. Note that you can only resize the partition where MEPIS Linux itself is installed by using the LiveCD.</li>
<li>Right-click on the partition and select &ldquo;Resize&rdquo;. Choose the new size of the partition. The free space that will remain will be used for MEPIS Linux installation; make sure the &ldquo;free space after&rdquo; resizing is larger than the minimum required size for your version of MEPIS Linux (see <a href="index.html#section03-1">minimum/recommended specifications</a>). Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;</li>
<li>Right-click on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; partition and select &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Select Partition Type: linux-swap. Enter the size you have chosen. Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Right-click on the &ldquo;free&rdquo; partition and select &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Select Ext3 and allot the amount of space you have chosen for root. Click &ldquo;OK&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Repeat the last steps to create a partition for home.</li>
<li>Click on the disk icon or go to <strong>File --&gt; Commit</strong>, respond &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to the dialog. GParted will now
repartition your drive; at the end you should get a message that the operation was completed successfully. </li>
<li><strong>Very Important!</strong> Note down the partition numbers/names as displayed in the new partition layout (e.g., sda3). You will need this information when choosing what partition number/name to install Mepis on, and to ensure that you do not overwrite your Windows partition!</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s03-4_other">Other partitioning considerations</h2>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>
A single hard drive can have only 4 primary partitions. If you need to have more than 4 partitions on the disk, you need to create an <strong>extended partition</strong>, which you can then divide into 15 or fewer <strong>logical partitions.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Many home computers are sold with a &ldquo;diagnostic partition&rdquo; and &ldquo;restore partition&rdquo;, in addition to the factory OS
install. If you see multiple partitions showing up in GParted that you were not aware of, they are probably these.
</li>
<li>Some computers need to be rebooted after changing the partitions before they can access the new partitions. If you are having trouble installing or formatting your new partitions, restart the computer and try again.
</li>
<li>After resizing an NTFS partition and booting back to Windows, Windows will claim the drive is &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; and do a disk check. This is normal, and no data corruption should result from the resize. Allow the check to run its course, and your drive should be fine after that.

<h2>4.0 Introduction</h2>
<p>The motto of MEPIS Linux 8.0 is &ldquo;Easy to try, easy to install, easy to use.&rdquo; And indeed, you will most likely discover that MEPIS Linux is the easiest and friendliest operating system installation you have ever used.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.1  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section04-1">4.1 Detailed steps</h1>
<p>At this point, you should have done the following:</p>
<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Downloaded the MEPIS Linux 8.0 ISO and burned it to a CD (see <a href="index.html#section02-2">Section 2.2</a>).</li>
<li>Backed up your important data (see <a href="index.html#section03-2">Section 3.2</a>).</li>
<li>Booted to the LiveCD (see <a href="index.html#section03-3">Section 3.3</a>).</li>
<li>Freed the necessary space on your hard drive (see <a href="index.html#section03-4">Section 3.4</a>).</li>
<li>Created partitions for MEPIS Linux 8.0 (see <a href="index.html#section03-4">Section 3.4</a>).  Optionally, you can do this during the
installation.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>Now all you will need to do is run through the simple installation wizard and then restart your machine. Depending on your configuration, this will probably take less than 15 minutes, and could even be as little as 5 minutes!</p>
<p>These instructions should cover most installation scenarios; for more details or for unusual circumstances, see the links below.</p>

<h2 id="s04-1_begin">Before you begin</h2>
<p>In most cases the MEPIS Linux 8.0 installation process should go fine.  But sometimes things can go wrong (because of user error, for instance) and potentially wipe out the contents of your hard drive. <strong>If you are not prepared for that possibility, stop now and protect your data</strong>.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s04-1_installer">Launch the Installer</h2>
<p>Boot to the LiveCD, logging in as <strong>demo,</strong> and click on the <strong>MEPIS Install</strong> icon once you are looking at the desktop.  When prompted for a password, enter <strong>root</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_license">License and Terms  </h3>
<p>Read through the license and terms of use.  Check <em>I agree to Terms</em> and click <strong>Next.</strong></p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg1">Page 1</h3>
<p>Select the disk on which you wish to install MEPIS Linux 8.0. Refer to <a href="index.html#section03-4">Section 3.4</a> if you are not sure what the Linux hard drive names mean. What you do next is determined by how you wish to set up your computer:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Auto install using entire disk</strong>
<br />
Select this option if you plan to use the entire hard drive for MEPIS Linux 8.0 and you aren't particular about how the partitions are set up. If you select this, the installer will create a root, swap, and home partition for you using the entire drive. You can optionally specify an amount of space to leave unused, if you plan to create more partitions afterward. <strong>Make sure you understand that selecting this option will delete any existing partitions and data</strong>.  Only choose this if you are not going to keep anything on the selected hard drive.
</li>
<li><strong>Custom install on existing partitions</strong>
<br />
If you are installing MEPIS Linux 8.0 to a dual-boot with another operating system, or you wish to define the sizes of your partitions manually, you need to select this option. If you have not previously set up your partitions (see section 3.4), you may click the button to run Gparted at this point and create them. You <em>must</em> have your partitions created before moving on if you want to select this option.
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s04-1_pg2">Page 2</h3>
<p>If you chose <strong>Auto-install using entire disk</strong> on the last page, you will not see this page.  Skip to the next step.  </p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Page 2(a):&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strong>If you chose <strong>custom install on existing partitions,</strong> you will now be prompted to select the partitions to install MEPIS Linux 8.0. Specify the <strong>root</strong> and <strong>swap</strong> partitions you have set up previously; if you have set up a separate partition for your <a href="index.html#s12-1_home-dir" class="spterm" title="Click to go to glossary entry." > home directory,</a>  specify it here, otherwise set <strong>home</strong> to &ldquo;root&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Page 2(b):&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strong> Check &ldquo;preserve /home&rdquo; if you are doing an upgrade
and already have data in an existing home partition. Select <strong>check for badblocks</strong> if you want to do a scan for physical defects on the harddrive during formatting. This <em>is</em> recommended. Finally, you can optionally select the type of filesystem you want to use on the hard drive. If you don't know what to choose here, the default <strong>ext3</strong> is recommended.
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s04-1_pg3">Page 3</h3>
<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 will now begin the install. You will be prompted to
confirm the formatting of each partition. Answer &ldquo;YES&rdquo; to each, then
sit back and relax while MEPIS Linux is copied to your hard drive. </p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg4">Page 4</h3>
<p>You now need to install GRUB, the bootloader (see <a href="index.html#section05-4"> Section 5.4</a>). In most cases, you should go with the
default setting (MBR). If you are concerned about writing to your hard drive's <a href="index.html#s12-1_mbr" class="spterm" title="Click
to go to Glossary entry."> MBR,</a> and wish to install to the MEPIS Linux root partition instead, select <strong>root</strong> (note that
you will need to manually edit the existing boot loader to boot to MEPIS Linux, either directly or by <a
href="index.html#s12-1_chainloading" class="spterm" title="Click to go to Glossary entry."> chainloading</a>). </p>

<p>If you are installing to MBR and have more than one hard drive, make sure you have the correct drive selected for &ldquo;system boot
disk.&rdquo; Usually this will be the first drive on the system (sda). </p>

<p>NOTE: The <strong>initrd</strong> option is only necessary for certain hardware configurations, usually only if your hard drive is
unusual (such as a SCSI drive). An <strong>initrd</strong> is an <em>initial RAM drive,</em> a virtual hard drive created in the system's memory that
allows the kernel to load special driver modules required to read the boot device (hard drive). Use it only if you have had trouble booting
from the default settings and know what you are doing.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg5">Page 5</h3>
<p>On this page you can enable or disable a few common services:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li><strong>guarddog</strong> is a software firewall used to protect your system from network security threats. It is recommended you
install guarddog; however, if you plan to install a different firewall (see <a href="index.html#section05-6-2">Section 5.6.2</a>), or you are not planning to connect to the internet, you can safely disable guarddog.
</li>
<li><strong>ppp</strong> is required for dialup internet connections, ADSL connections, and PPTP support. Note that if you have DSL but
connect your computers through a router, you do not need PPP.
</li>
<li><strong>bluez</strong> is for bluetooth device support.  If you do not have bluetooth capabilities on your computer, you may safely
disable bluez.
</li>
<li><strong>cupsys</strong> is the Common Unix Printing System. You
should install cupsys if you intend to print from this machine or use
it as a print server.
</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3 id="s04-1_pg6">Page 6</h3>
<p>Here is where you specify your computer's name and DNS domain. On most home networks the DNS domain does not matter; however, if you are
on a large corporate network, or your network has its own internal DNS server, you can set your domain name here.</p>

<p>You can also enable or disable the Samba server and configure the  Samba workgroup (see <a href="index.html#section05-6-3">Section 5.6.3</a>). If you have other computers running Windows on your network and wish to share files or printers to them, enable this setting.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg7">Page 7</h3>
<p>If you are in the United States, the default locale settings should be fine for you. If you are outside the USA, select the keyboard and locale settings appropriate to your language and country.</p>

<p>You can also indicate here whether your hardware clock is set to GMT (a.k.a. UTC). If you are dual-booting with Microsoft Windows, you will want to leave this unselected. If you are installing on Apple hardware or if this computer will only run Linux, check this box.</p>

<h3 id="s04-1_pg8">Page 8</h3>
<p>On this page you will set up a username and password for the default user, and a password for the root (administrative) user. </p>
<p>Usernames:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Are case sensitive.  For simplicity's sake, use all lower case.</li>
<li>Should not contain spaces or symbols</li>
<li>Can also be created using MEPIS User Assistant (see <a href="index.html#section05-3-3">section 5.3.3</a>) after installation, if you need more users.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<p>Passwords:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Are case-sensitive.</li>
<li>Should be secure, especially the root password. They should be at least six characters, contain a mix of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols, and should not be based on a dictionary word.</li>
<li>Should not be forgotten. You'll need to have root password to do any administrative task on the computer, such as installing software or configuring hardware.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h3>Finished!</h3>
<p>This concludes the setup. Click <strong>Finish,</strong> and you will be prompted as to whether or not you want to reboot. Click
<strong>YES.</strong> The LiveCD will shut down and the disc will be ejected. You can now boot into MEPIS Linux!</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.2  ########################### -->


<h1 id="section04-2">4.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special situations</h1>


<h2 id="s04-2_older">Older hardware</h2>
<p>If you are trying to install MEPIS Linux 8.0 on older hardware, and the LiveCD is running very slowly, try the following:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't load KDE</strong>: At the login menu, go to the <em>Session</em> menu and select <strong>failsafe</strong>,
then log in as root (password is <em>root</em>). You will find yourself at a command prompt. Enter the command <strong>minstall</strong>. This will launch the installation wizard, and you can proceed with section 4.1 from step 2.</li>

<li><strong>Install using a different machine</strong>: Remove the hard drive from your old computer, and insert it into a faster machine. Run the
MEPIS Linux 8.0 install as described in section 4.1. After installation is complete, remove the hard drive and put it back in the old machine.
Because MEPIS Linux 8.0 redetects all hardware on every boot (rather than once during the installation), you should have little or no problem.</li>

<li><strong>Try antiX</strong>: If your hardware is very old (near or below the minimum requirements), you may have better results from antiX. This
community remaster of MEPIS Linux 8.0 was designed for old machines.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->


<h2>Without a CD</h2>

<p>Even if your computer does not have a bootable CD or DVD drive, you can install MEPIS Linux 8.0.</p>

<p>For instance, if your system supports booting from a USB drive (Apple does not) you should be able to boot to the flash drive
and proceed with the install normally. On a second computer, boot to the LiveCD and create a bootable MEPIS Linux 8.0 flash drive using the MEPIS System Assistant. Most users report this method is actually much faster than a traditional CD installation.  Check the Wiki of MepisLovers forum for details and current status.</p>

<p>For other alternative boot methods, see this <a href="index.html#s04-3_links"> Links and Guides</a> subsection.</p>



<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.3  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section04-3">4.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshooting</h1>

<h2>Lockups during installation</h2>
<p>If MEPIS Linux 8.0 is locking up during installation, it is usually due to a problem with faulty computer hardware, or a bad CD. Refer to <a href="index.html#s02-3_verify">Section 2.3</a> for details on verifying your MEPIS Linux 8.0 CD.</p>

<p>If you have determined that the CD is not the problem, it may be due to faulty RAM, a faulty hard drive, or some other piece of faulty or incompatible hardware.</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>Refer to the Links and Guides at the bottom of the page  for details on testing your RAM and Hard drive for physical defects.</li>

<li>Shut down your computer and remove any non-essential hardware, then attempt the installation again. Non-essential hardware may include
USB, serial, and parallel-port devices; removable PCI, AGP, PCIE, modem slot, or ISA expansion cards (excluding video, if you do not have
onboard video); SCSI devices (unless you are installing to or from one); IDE or SATA devices that you are not installing to or from;
joysticks, MIDI cables, audio cables, and any other external multimedia devices.</li>

<li>Add one of the Boot Options space at the bottom where the cursor is blinking (see <a href="index.html#section03-3">Section 3.3</a>).</li>

<li>Systems often lock up due to overheating. Open the computer's case and ensure that all the system's fans are running when it is turned on. If your BIOS supports it, check the CPU and Motherboard temperatures and compare them to the temperature specifications for your system.</li>

<li>Your CD drive may be having problems. If your system supports it, create a MEPIS Linux 8.0 bootable USB flash drive and install from
that.</li>
</ul>
<!-- ###################  end unordered list ################# -->

<h2>Installed MEPIS Linux 8.0 does not boot</h2>
<p>After a reboot, it sometimes happens that your computer reports that no operating system or bootable disk was found. Usually, this means
that either you failed to install GRUB, or you failed to mark at least one partition bootable (a.k.a. &ldquo;active&rdquo;) during custom
partitioning of the hard drive.</p>
<p>To fix this, try the following:</p>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Boot to the LiveCD, log in as <strong>demo</strong></li>

<li>Launch Gparted, and select the drive on which you installed MEPIS Linux 8.0</li>

<li>The partition on which you installed MEPIS Linux 8.0 should say &ldquo;Active&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Status&rdquo; field. If it does not,
right-click it and select <strong>set active.</strong> Then click <strong>Commit.</strong></li>

<li>If that was not the problem, launch <a href="index.html#section05-3-2">the MEPIS System Assistant </a> and run a GRUB repair. If you did not previously install GRUB to the MBR, this might be something to try. Experts can use the <strong>initrd</strong> option.</li>

<li>If this still does not fix it, you may have a faulty hard drive. Use the <a href="index.html#section05-3-2">the MEPIS System Assistant </a>  (from the LiveCD) to check your MEPIS Linux 8.0 partition for bad blocks.</li>
</ol>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.4  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section04-4">4.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apple Intel computers</h1>


<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 is compatible with Apple Intel computers: those based on Intel x86 CPUs, with the exception of some small details.  Intel Core 2 or Xenon-based Apple computers can run 64-bit MEPIS, but all Intel-Core-based Apple computers can run 32-bit MEPIS.</p>

<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 has a utility for preparing your Apple bootable hard drive for OS X so that you can install MEPIS Linux painlessly. This <em>MEPIS Assistant</em> is compatible with OS X Tiger and Leopard. There is a README file in the in the LiveCD OSX directory  with more information.</p>
<p>Instructions for installation:</p>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Put the MEPIS Linux 8.0 media into an appropriate drive, and use the Finder to navigate to the OS X folder of the CD or
DVD.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the MEPIS Linux 8.0 Assistant for OS X (<strong>SimplyMEPIS Assistant.app.zip</strong>) to the OS X desktop.</li>
<li>Unzip it, then launch the SimplyMEPIS  Assistant.app and follow the instructions.</li>
<li>When prompted, reboot into the CD or DVD and install MEPIS Linux 8.0 following the directions in <a href="index.html#section04-1">Section 4.1</a>.</li>
<li>Install MEPIS Linux 8.0 on the partition you created with the MEPIS Linux 8.0 Assistant for OS X.</li>
<li>After installing MEPIS Linux 8.0, return to the Assistant in OS X to enable dual booting.
</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->

<p>NOTE: the Installer disables options that would be likely to damage your OS X System Drive.  <strong>Do not try to use <em>Parted,
GParted,</em> or <em>QTParted</em></strong> to do anything on an OS X System Drive. If used, <em>parted</em> will probably destroy the OS X installation and make the disk unbootable.</p>


<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />





<!-- ########################### SECTION 4.5  ########################### -->


<h1 id="section04-5">4.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstalling MEPIS Linux</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In many instances, removing MEPIS is no different from that of any other operating system.  But when you need to remove MEPIS from a dual boot system and restore the original single partition structure, the procedure is somewhat more complicated.</p>
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s04-5_remove">Remove the Linux partition</h2>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Boot up the LiveCD and log in as your regular user.
</li>
<li>Click KMenu --> System --> Settings --> Partition Editor (GParted), and supply the root password.
</li>
<li>In the upper right corner of the screen, select the hard drive (you will see a Windows partition when you have the right one).
</li>
<li>Right-click the MEPIS Linux drive or drives, and select delete from the menu. If delete is not there, choose "resize" and shrink it to zero.
</li>
<li>When all Linux drives are done, then resize the Windows drive to the maximum.
</li>
<li>Reboot without the CD into Windows, which will probably tell you it has to check the drive.
</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s04-5_mbr">Restore the MBR</h2>

<p>If GRUB (the boot loader used by MEPIS Linux) was installed on the <a href="index.html#s12-1_mbr" class="spterm" title="Click
to go to Glossary entry."> MBR </a> (master boot record at the very beginning of a hard drive), you will probably also have to reinstall the Windows bootloader in one of the following ways:</p>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>

<li>
For XP, you do that by booting the Windows install CD and picking the repair option. Once you get to a DOS screen you can issue the command:
<pre>fixmbr</pre>
</li>

<li>If you do not have the Windows CD, you can repair the MBR with third-party software such as Active@ Partition Recovery for DOS (link below).  You may need to have backed up the MBR.
</li>

<li>Alternatively, you can boot into the Windows Recovery console on the hard drive, and run fixmbr from there.  For booting, use the MEPIS Live CD and run grub from the command line.  Then enter the following commands from the grub prompt:
<pre>
root (hd0,0)
chainloader +1
boot
</pre>
NOTE: (hd0,0) may have to be changed, depending on which disk/partition Windows is installed.
<br />&nbsp;
</li>

<li>If the Windows Recovery console isn't available by default, you can create it in Windows by finding WINNT32.EXE and running this from the Windows command line and rebooting afterwards:
<pre>C:\I386\WINNT32.EXE /cmdcons</pre>
NOTE: The I386 folder may appear in different places on different systems.
<br />&nbsp;
</li> 
 
<li>Alternatively, the MEPIS Live CD has a built-in application, ms-sys, to restore the Windows 2000/XP/2003 MBR on the hard disk.  Run this command from the Konsole (terminal) as root:
<pre> ms-sys -m /dev/sda</pre>
NOTE: if the boot disk is different than sda, then change the name accordingly.
<br />&nbsp;
</li>

<li>For Windows Vista, follow the link below on how to use the Bootrec.exe tool.

<h1 id="section05-2-1">5.2.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a camera </h1>

<p>In most cases MEPIS Linux will add a camera automatically:</p>

<!-- ###################  start ordered list ################# -->
<ol>
<li>Switch on your camera in 'play' mode and connect it to your computer.</li>
<li>A camera or USB Imaging icon should appear on the desktop.</li>
<li>A dialog box will open, asking you what you want to do with the new medium that has been detected. Choose whether to open in a new
window or have Digikam upload the photos.</li>
<li>If you do not see the dialog box, you can click <strong>Kmenu --> Graphics --> Photo management (digiKam)</strong></li>
<li>On the menu bar, click <strong>Camera --> Add camera --> Auto detect</strong></li>
<li>Digikam will normally detect and list your camera.</li>
</ol>
<!-- ###################  end ordered list ################# -->

<p>If your camera uses a multimedia card for storage, you may find it easiest to use a card reader (cheap if not built in) to connect to your USB port.  Under MEPIS Linux, it will show up as an additional media device on your desktop, and you can read and write to it as if it were a
hard or floppy disk.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 class="05-2-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<!-- ###################  start unordered list ################# -->
<ul>
<li>If your camera is visible as a USB device in KInfoCenter (<strong>KMenu --> System --> InfoCenter (KInfoCenter)</strong>), make sure your user-id is a member of the 'camera' group by clicking
<strong>KMenu --> System --> More Applications --> KUser</strong> (see KUser handbook linked below)
</li>
<li>If your camera does not appear, check to see if it is on the USB device list linked below.
</li>
<li>Google for the keywords "gphoto2 YourCameraMake YourCameraModel". Look for a changelog that includes your model. Check the version of the changelog and compare it to the output of typing this into a terminal:
<pre>gphoto2 --version</pre>
You may need a new version of <strong>gphoto2</strong> if the older version
of the program does not recognize the camera.  See whether one is available from the MEPIS Community Repository or search the MepisLovers Forum (see Links &amp; Guides).  See <a href="index.html#s07-3_source">Section 7.3: Other install methods: source code</a> if you need to compile it yourself.
</li>
<li>Kodak cameras often present particular problems.  If you can't get Digikam to upload your pictures, try using the Kodak cameras upload script linked below.

<h2>Basic operation</h2>
<p>Printers are manually installed through the KDE Control Center, if not done automatically, while printing itself is enabled by CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System).  A printer can be added by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click<strong> KMenu --> Control Center --> Peripherals --> Printers</strong> </li>
<li>Click <strong>Administrative Mode</strong> button at the bottom, and supply root's password.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Add --> Add Printer/Class</strong>, and the Add Printer Wizard will start.</li>
<li>Most users will be installing a local printer, the first radio button, but other options  are available.  See <a href="index.html#section09-1">Section 9.1</a> for sharing printers and <a href="index.html#section08-01">Section 8.1</a> for accessing a Windows printer through Samba.</li>
<li>When setting up a printer across a network, you may have to disable your firewall (see <a href="index.html#section05-6-2">Section 5.6.2</a>).</li>
<li>Follow the screens to locate the auto-detected printer (usually), identify the make and model, load the recommended driver, and print a
test page.</li>
<li>If page prints correctly, continue through the Wizard screens, making sure to name your printer in a way that you will recognize.</li>
</ol>
<p>TIP: if you have trouble setting up the printer through the normal channels, try setting it up over the network by using a browser to navigate to:</p>
 <pre>http://localhost:631/</pre> 
<p>Click on the <strong>Administration</strong> tab, then on the appropriate button for your need.</p>

<h1 id="section05-2-4">5.2.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a webcam </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Webcams have traditionally been tricky to configure with Linux, and MEPIS was no exception. However, MEPIS Linux 8.0 uses the latest Linux kernel, 2.6.27, which includes webcam drivers that make the process much easier than before.</p> 

<p>KDE 3.5 does appear to have built-in Webcam video support, but it does not support audio, so the extent of functionality depends on whether the user wants audio as well as video, and on the webcam itself (as well as the driver it requires). This is set to change when KDE 4 is mature, at which point MEPIS users will have further options available.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-2-4_basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Here are the basic steps to take:</p>
<ul><!-- ##########  start  main list  ##########  -->
<li>First, plug in the webcam, and see if it works! Webcams using common drivers will often work just fine.
<br />
 To test whether it is working, try these options: 

<ul> <!-- ##########  start sublist  ##########  -->
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --&gt; Internet --&gt; Instant Messaging --&gt; Kopete</strong>, then click on the menu
bar
Settings --&gt; Configure... --&gt;Devices. After a few seconds, you should see the webcam's view.
</li>
<li>Install <strong>Skype</strong>, then click on Options --> Video Devices
</li>
<li>Install <strong>cheese</strong>, then click Video and Start recording.
</li>
<li>Install <strong>camstream</strong>, then click File --> Open Viewer and select your webcam.
</li>
</ul></li><!-- ########## end sublist  ##########  -->

<li>If one of those procedures does not work--and webcams often only work with certain applications--get the brand and model and USB ID of your webcam by opening a terminal and typing:
<pre>lsusb
</pre>
Output for the webcam will resemble this:
<pre>Bus 001 Device 002: ID <strong>046d:0870</strong> Logitech, Inc. QuickCam Express
</pre>
</li>
<li>Google the device ID (bolded) to find out about its driver and Linux status.
</li>
<li>Check the webcam tables linked below for information and help.
</li>
<li>Search MepisLovers forum, then post your brand, model and device ID number (use <strong>lsusb</strong>) if still having trouble.
</li>
</ul><!-- ########## end  main list  ##########  -->

<p>NOTE: If looking to buy a new webcam, many users report consistent good luck with those supported by <strong>uvcvideo</strong>, and <strong>gspca</strong>, now supplied as modules with the new kernel.</p>

<h1 id="section05-2-5">5.2.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a scanner </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Scanners are supported in Linux by SANE (&ldquo;Scanner Access Now Easy&rdquo;) which is an <em>application programming interface</em>
(API) that provides standardized access to any raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner, video- and still-cameras,
frame-grabbers, etc.).</p>
<br />

<h2>Basic steps</h2>
<p>You can manage your scanner in MEPIS Linux with the default KDE frontend Kooka by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --> Graphics --> Scan and OCR Program (Kooka)</strong></li>
<li>Kooka will check the system for scanners and present you with a list of what it  has found.</li>
<li>For details on how to use Kooka, see the Kooka handbook linked below.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-2-5_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your scanner is listed as supported by SANE by following the link below.</li>
<li>Sometimes there is a conflict with another driver that leads to various odd behaviors.  To check:
<ol> <!--sublist -->
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --> System --> File System --> File Manager - Super User Mode</strong>, and supply root's password.</li>
<li>Type (or copy and paste) into the address bar:
<pre>
/etc/sane.d/dll.d/libsane-extras
</pre>
</li>

<li>The file will open.  There should be a <strong># </strong> symbol at the beginning of this line to &ldquo;comment out&rdquo; the driver:
<pre>
geniusvp2
</pre>
</li>
<li>If not, put one there, save the file and exit </li>

<h1  id="section05-2-6">5.2.6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to set up a PDA </h1>
<p>Success with using a PDA on MEPIS Linux depends on the handheld OS and hardware being used.</p>

<h2>Palm devices</h2>
<p>
        PalmOS devices work pretty well with Linux, and offer many advanced possibilities. All interactions depend on pilot-link, an application that is installed by default with MEPIS Linux. A number of different frontends are available to use this backend on MEPIS, including Kpilot and Jpilot.
      </p>
<h3 id="s05-2-6_prelim">Preliminaries</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure your handheld data are backed up before you start.</li>
<li>Make sure all your device entries are correct, including spelling and capitalization</li>
<li>If you are using a Palm device that has been used on another PC, restore the factory defaults (hard reset)</li>
<li>Make sure that the modules you need are loaded: <strong>visor</strong>, <strong>usbserial</strong> and <strong>uhci_hcd</strong> or <strong>ehci_hcd</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s05-2-6_setup">Setup</h3>
<p>The following technique works on MEPIS with many Palm devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using any installation method, install these packages:
<pre>
pilot-link
kpilot
libpisock9
</pre>
</li>
<li> Connect your Palm handheld to the computer</li>
<li>Open Kpilot and connect manually (the automatic detection method usually crashes the program) 
by clicking on Settings --> Configure Kpilot and click on Device in the left panel. Set the following parameters:
<pre>Pilot device:  &#047;dev&#047;ttyUSB0
Speed: 115200 (unless serial connection, then try 19200)
Workarounds: None (check another choice if applicable)
Encoding: default, unless you know differently
Pilot user: user name for your handheld</pre>
</li>
<li>If you are synching with Kontact for calendar addresses, click on Addressbook in the left panel, and check vCard file as the Sync Destination, then Calendar with Calendar file checked as the Sync Destination.  KPilot will connect automatically with the correct files.</li>
<li>Once setup has worked, you can usually perform a hot sync simply by pressing the hot sync button on your handheld or its cradle, though some setups may require clicking KPilot first.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2>Diagnosis tab</h2>
<p>This tab provides easy access to network diagnostic problems using well-established tools.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Ping</strong> is used to send small data packets to another network host as a basic test for connectivity. It will test your connection to any IP address or hostname you give it; try something like <strong>www.yahoo.com</strong> to see how it works.  Ten packets is often enough, but you can select any number by using the arrows.  Consult the MEPIS Wiki link in the <a href="#s05-3_links"> Links and Guides</a> section on how to read and use the output. </li>
<li><strong>Traceroute</strong> shows you the route over the network between two systems, listing all the intermediate routers a connection must pass through ("hops") to get to its destination. It can help you determine why your connections to a given server might be poor, and can often help you figure out where exactly the problem is. Try something like <strong>www.yahoo.com</strong> to see how it works.  Ten hops is often enough, but you can select any number by using the arrows.  Consult the MEPIS Wiki in the <a href="#s05-3_links"> Links and Guides</a> section on how to read and use the output.</li>

used when running from the LiveCD.
</li>

<li id="s05-3-2_repair-partition"><u>Repair Partition</u>:
This tab allows a partition to be tested for errors and bad blocks.  It may not be run from within the partition that needs to be
checked, and for that reason is usually run from the LiveCD.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.3.3  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section05-3-3">5.3.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;  User Assistant </h1>

<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />


<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.3.4  ########################### -->


<h1 id="section05-3-4">5.3.4:&nbsp;&nbsp; X-Windows Assistant </h1>
<p>This utility brings together a number of configuration steps for <strong>&ldquo;X&rdquo;</strong>, the window system used by MEPIS Linux.
You can start it from <strong>KMenu --> System --> MEPIS --> MEPIS X-Windows Assistant</strong> (command line: <strong>mxconfig</strong>). 
It has six
tabs.</p>

<h2 id="s05-3-4_repair-x">Repair </h2>

<p>This tab is intended to be used from the LiveCD. It allows you to copy the automatically-generated X configuration from the LiveCD
onto a hard drive installation of MEPIS Linux. This is useful if you've made a configuration error and the X graphical interface will no longer
start (all you get is a command-line log-in prompt)</p>

<ul>
<li>In the second, select the partition where &ldquo;/&rdquo; is mounted. </li>
<li>When you click OK or Apply, X-Windows Assistant will copy the X configuration file
<strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> from the LiveCD to the folder on the partition you have specified.</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This utility is only useful from a hard drive install when you have MEPIS Linux or a similar Debian-based Linux distribution on another
partition, and you'd like to copy the <strong>xorg.conf</strong> file from that one to another.</p>
<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_general-x">General </h2>
<p>This tab allows you to change the dpi (dots-per-inch) setting of on-screen text. Change this if your monitor's size or resolution causes text to be too large or too small and you want to uniformly increase or decrease the size of all text rendered in X windows.</p> 
<p>NOTE: The font sizes of KDE applications can be adjusted under <strong>KMenu --> System Configuration (Settings) --> Appearance &amp; Themes
--> Fonts</strong>. </p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_mouse-x">Mouse </h2>
<p>This tab simply allows you to activate or deactivate different mouse types on your system. Most users shouldn't have a reason to deactivate any of these devices; MEPIS Linux will work fine even if nonexistent mouse devices are enabled.</p>
<p>NOTE: More fine-tuned control of the mouse's behavior is available under <strong>KMenu --> System Configuration (Settings) --> Peripherals -->
Mouse</strong>.</p>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_monitor-x">Monitor </h2>
<p>This tool allows you to specify the brand and model of your Monitor, and if necessary, alter its frequencies. Changing the frequencies
may be necessary if you are having trouble getting the full range of available video resolutions from your monitor.</p>

<p>If you don't find your monitor listed in the brand/model menus, you can type in the monitor's vertical and horizontal frequency ranges
manually. Make sure you consult your monitor's documentation! </p>
<p>NOTES: 1) Be very careful with this tool! Setting your monitor to the wrong model or setting the wrong frequency ranges can cause you
to lose video, or even potentially damage your monitor. If you are happy with the resolution you are getting, it's best to leave this tool
alone.  2) See <a href="index.html#section05-5">Section 5.5</a> for detailed display configuration and troubleshooting.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_nvidia">NVIDIA </h2>
<p>If you have an Nvidia graphics card, this tool assists you in installing the drivers. You have a choice of four drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>The latest Nvidia driver</u>: This is a proprietary driver that works with newer Nvidia cards - see the Nvidia Unix Portal page linked below for supported products list. </li>
<li><u>The legacy Nvidia driver</u>: This is also a proprietary driver, but it works with older Nvidia cards (for Riva/TNT/GeForce 2 - use the 7xxx from the Nvidia website linked below. </li>
<li><u>The NV driver</u>: This is an open-source driver from Xorg, but it lacks 3D support.</li> 
<li><u>VESA</u>: This is a generic driver that provides basic functionality (2D, 1024x768 resolution) to most video cards. Use it for
troubleshooting.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using the proprietary drivers, you can set other options here such as dual monitor settings or shadow curser mode.</p> 
<p>NOTE: If you are uncertain of which driver to use, consult the list of NVIDIA supported cards linked below.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-3-4_ati">ATI </h2>

<h1 id="section05-4">5.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GRUB bootloader</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>GRUB is the default boot loader used by MEPIS Linux.  A boot loader is software that tells your computer where to find operating
systems to boot. When you start your computer, GRUB will provide you with a menu of choices. It is a very powerful boot loader that can load a wide variety of free operating systems, as well as proprietary operating systems with an indirect boot technique known as <a
href="index.html#s12-1_chainloading"  class="spterm" title="A method of loading other operating systems."> chainloading.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-4_overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The typical default GRUB screen in MEPIS Linux  shows 3 kernel entries for MEPIS, any other detected OS, and a MEMTEST entry.  It looks something like this (here for a dual_boot with Windows XP on a system with a single hard drive): </p>
<pre>
timeout 15
color cyan/blue white/blue
foreground ffffff
background 0639a1

gfxmenu /boot/grub/message

title MEPIS 8 at sda2, newest kernel
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/sda2 nomce quiet splash vga=791 
boot

title MEPIS at sda2, previous kernel (if any)
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz.old root=/dev/sda2 nomce quiet splash vga=791 
boot

title MEPIS at sda2, kernel 2.6.27-1-mepis-smp
root (hd0,1)
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.27-1-mepis-smp root=/dev/sda2
boot

title Microsoft Windows XP Professional at sda1
rootnoverify (hd0,0)
chainloader +1

title MEMTEST
kernel /boot/memtest86+.bin
</pre>

<p>Three kernel entries are listed for technical reasons: details in the Wiki discussion of GRUB under <em> Links and Guides</em> below.
</p>
<p>The final entry, Memtest is a thorough, stand-alone memory test for 386, 486 and Pentium systems. It writes a series of test patterns
to every memory address, then reads back the data written and compares it for errors.  See <a href="index.html#section08-07">Section 8.7</a>.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-4_grub">Configuring GRUB</h2>
<p>After successfully installing a dual-boot system, many people want to adapt it to their environment.</p>
<h3>Configuring the boot menu timeout</h3>
<p>It is possible to change the length of time for which the boot menu is shown. This is useful if you would like the computer to start up
faster (without the delay of showing the menu) or would like more time to choose which operating system to start.</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --> System --> File System --> File Manager--Super User Mode</strong>, and supply the root password.</li>
<li>In the navigation bar, type <strong>/boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> and hit return.  This will open the configuration file for GRUB
(menu.lst) that you can now edit.</li>
<li>The first line contains text similar to the following:
<pre>
timeout 30
</pre>
This line determines the time, in seconds, during which the boot menu will be shown. Change the number on this line to the number of seconds you would like. Use <strong>0</strong> if you would not like the menu to be shown at all.</li>
<li>Click <strong>File --> Save</strong> to save your changes and then <strong>Exit</strong>. Your changes should take effect the next
time you restart your computer.</li>
</ol>

<br />

<h3 id="s05-4_change-default">Changing the default operating system to boot</h3>
<p>You can decide which operating system will be started automatically if you have not chosen one from the boot menu within a certain time.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> file as root using the method indicated above, and add the following option just above the first
&ldquo;title&rdquo; entry:</p>

<pre>
default <em>n</em>
</pre>

<p>Change the variable <em>n</em> to &ldquo;0&rdquo; to boot from the first entry in the menu, &ldquo;1&rdquo; for the second, and so forth.
Save the file and exit. The changes will take effect the next time the computer boots.
</p>
<p>An alternative method is to cut the entry for the OS you want to boot by default and paste it in first title position.</p>

<p>A computer network is simply defined as “A connection of two or more computers so that they can share resources.” Resources are in the form of hardware (i.e., printers), software, data, Internet connection, etc. Setting up a home network is a fairly straightforward task. But it is a good idea to arm yourself with a little knowledge to make things easier, as well as safer (from a security point of view). See Links and Guides below for background information. </p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.6.1.1  ########################### -->


<h1  id="section05-6-1-1">5.6.1.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wired Internet Access </h1>

<p>MEPIS Linux typically picks up wired internet access upon boot without much problem.</p>

<h3>Ethernet and cable</h3>

<p>MEPIS Linux comes preconfigured for a standard LAN (Local Area Network) that uses DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) to assign IP addresses and DNS (Domain Name System) resolution. This will work in most cases as-is. You can change the configuration with the MEPIS Network Assistant (see <a href="index.html#section05-3">Section 5.3</a>).

When you boot MEPIS Linux, your network adapters are assigned a short interface name by udev, the kernel's device manager. For normal wired adapters this is usually eth0 (with subsequent adapters eth1, eth2, eth3, etc). Wireless adapters often come up on the eth0 interface in MEPIS Linux, but the interface name depends on the adapter's chipset. For instance, atheros cards often show up as ath0, while ralink usb adapters will be rausb0. To find out what interfaces have been detected and named in your system, click KMenu --> System --> Info Center --> Network Interfaces. For more details, open a terminal, become root, and enter: </p>
<pre>ifconfig -a</pre>

<p>It is highly recommended that you have a firewall (see <a href="index.html#section05-6-2">Section 5.6.2</a>) running if you are connecting directly to the Internet with your PC!  If you are running a stand-alone/external firewall, most of which will run DHCP by default, simply connect to the
router/hub/switch and your machine should autoconfigure via DHCP. </p>

<h3>ADSL or PPPoE</h3>

<p>If you use ADSL or PPPoE, connecting to the internet is relatively easy. Click Kmenu --> Internet --> Connection --> ADSL/PPPoE configuration, supply the root password, and follow the different screens, where you will be asked for some ISP information (like your username and password). Complete that section and you will be surfing the Internet a few seconds later.</p>

<h3>Dial-Up</h3>

<p>If you use a dialup connection with your computer, you will use KPPP. Click KMenu --> Internet --> Connection --> Internet Dialup Tool (KPPP) to define a connection, test that the modem is working, and dial your ISP.</p>

<p>On the Device tab you will need to set up the serial information. These are the equivalents of the COM ports under MS-DOS and MS-Windows&#174;:</p>

<ul>
 <li>COM 1 - /dev/ttyS0</li>
 <li>COM 2 - /dev/ttyS1</li>
 <li>COM 3 - /dev/ttyS2</li>
 <li>COM 4 - /dev/ttyS3</li>
</ul>
 
<p>For configuration details, see the KPPP Handbook in Links and Guides.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-6-1-1_clu">Command line utilities</h2>
<p>Command line utilities are useful for seeing detailed information, and are also commonly used in troubleshooting.  Most must be run <u>as root</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
ifconfig - main configuration utility for network interfaces. Full documentation can be found by typing <strong>man:ifconfig</strong> into
the Konqueror address bar.
</li>
<li>ifup interface - bring up the specified interface. For example: 
<pre>ifup eth0 - command that brings up the ethernet port eth0
ifup wlan0 - command that brings up the wireless port wlan0
</pre>
</li>
<li>ifdown interface - the opposite of <strong>ifup</strong>. 
</li>
<li>iwconfig - wireless network connection utility. Full documentation can be found by typing <strong>man:iwconfig</strong> into the Konqueror Location bar . For example: 
<pre>
iwconfig - by itself, iwconfig will display your wireless status
iwconfig eth0 essid any - this command connects eth0 to any AP in range
iwconfig wlan0 essid foo - connects wlan0 to AP with essid "foo"
iwconfig eth0 key off - clears out the WEP key
iwconfig ath0 key 12345678901 - sets ath0's WEP key to 12345678901
</pre>
</li>
<li>
iwlist - another wireless ethernet utility. In Konqueror, type the URL: <strong>man:iwlist</strong> into Konqueror for the Iwlist man page. Example of use: 
<pre>
iwlist wlan0 scanning - shows properties of wireless networks within range of wlan0.
iwlist ath0 bitrate   - shows the current speed of communications on ath0.
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-6-1-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Ethernet cards in MEPIS Linux are configured in the file <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong>. The file is actually very simple in format and syntax, and not hard to edit in the event that other tools fail. See documentation by typing "man:interfaces" into the address bar of Konqueror.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 5.6.1.2  ########################### -->

<h1 id="section05-6-1-2">5.6.1.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Wireless Internet Access </h1>

<p>MEPIS Linux comes preconfigured to autodetect a WiFi card, and in many cases your card will be found and set up.  If not, see below for the basic steps for enabling wireless.</p>

<p>There are three ways wireless can be supported in MEPIS:</p>
<ul>
<li>With a native driver that comes as part of the Linux kernel (example: <strong>ipw3945</strong> for Intel).</li>

<li>With a Windows driver using the application Ndiswrapper (supplied by default), which "wraps" your Windows driver so that it can be used in a Linux system (example: <strong>bcmwl5</strong> for Broadcom). </li>
<li>With a Windows driver using the commercial product Linuxant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes there is both a native Linux driver and a Windows driver available.  You may want to compare them for speed and connectivity, and you may have to remove the one you are not using to prevent a conflict.  For more information, see Links and Guides below.</p>

<p>Wireless cards can be either internal or external.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some computers contain inexpensive internal modems that are designed only for use with MS-Windows.  These are called variously
winmodems, linmodems or  softmodems. MEPIS Linux 7.0 includes drivers for many common winmodems, but others may prove more difficult to
configure.</li>
<li>External serial wireless modems generally tend to work without problem. </li> 

<li>USB modems (wireless dongles) usually show up on the rausb0 interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>NOTE: The successful method varies for users because of the complicated interactions among the Linux kernel, wireless tools, and the local wireless card chipset and router.</p>

<br />

<h3 id="s05-6-1-2_3gmodems">3G modems</h3>
<p>For wireless internet access using a 3G modem, please refer to the Debian Wiki's 3G pages linked at the bottom of the page.</p>

<br /><br />


<!--This is modified from separate "wireless" page in M7-->
<h2 id="s05-6-1-2_basic">Basic Wireless Steps</h2>

<ol> <!-- top level list-->
<li>It is sometimes easier to start without encryption first, then add it afterwards. This will only work if the access point to which you are trying to connect is itself unencrypted &mdash;and you may legally use an access point only if you own it or have permission from the owner.
</li>
<li>If you installed MEPIS-64, make sure any drivers you are trying to use are 64-bit drivers.
</li>
<li>Configure your card with MEPIS Network Assistant (command line:
<strong>mnetwork</strong>), by clicking <strong>KMenu --&gt; Internet --&gt; Connection --&gt; MEPIS
Network Assistant</strong> and supplying the root password.  For most users, the only step required will be to fill in the ESSID of the desired network. See <a href="index.html#section05-3-1">Section 5.3.1</a> for details. 
</li>

<li>Some cards may require particular methods because of the chipset they use. To find out what chipset your card uses, open the MEPIS Network Assistant and click on the Troubleshooting tab.  In the top panel, Hardware, click the Scan Hardware button to find the information you need to get help.  Check the MEPIS Wiki Wireless section linked below for "Particular cards," or search the MepisLovers forum  (see <a href="index.html#section11-1">Section 11: More resources</a>) to find relevant and up-to-date help.
</li>

<li>If MEPIS Network Assistant doesn't work, try to configure your card in a root terminal with the <a href="index.html#s05-6-1-1_clu">command line utilities</a>.
</li>
<li>If you have hardware recognized but are not able to connect with the methods listed above, try downloading and installing another wireless
front end application such as Wicd, Ceni, Wlassistant or Wifi-Radar (see link to Wiki page on wireless).  Please note that MEPIS can not
guarantee the performance of these applications.
</li>
<li>If your card starts but does not connect, check the <strong>Use static DNS </strong> button on the <em>General</em> tab of MEPIS Network
Assistant, and click <strong>Apply</strong> if necessary. If that works, then reboot, go into Network Assistant again, and try to switch
back to <strong>Use DHCP for DNS.</strong>
</li>
<li>If WEP or WPA does not work, follow the Wiki page on wireless link below.  The frontend Wicd is particularly strong on WPA.
</li>
<li>If still no luck, post the following information on the MepisLovers forum:
<ul> <!-- sublist 3 -->
<li>your MEPIS version and architecture (32 or 64)</li>
<li>the output of entering the following into a terminal as root:
<pre>iwconfig
lspci | grep -i net (lsusb | grep -i net, for a usb adapter)
ndiswrapper -l
</pre>
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 3 -->
</ol>
<h2>Native drivers</h2>
<p>MEPIS 8 includes a large number of native wireless drivers among its kernel modules.  The directions vary somewhat for each, and in some cases you will need to also obtain the firmware (small programs that internally control various electronic devices).  Pease consult the MEPIS Wiki on native drivers, linked below.</p>
<h2>Ndiswrapper</h2>
<p>Ndiswrapper is an open source software driver "wrapper" that enables the use of Microsoft Windows drivers for wireless network devices in Linux.  It comes pre-installed in MEPIS 8, along with a number of the most common Windws drivers.  Note that you MUST use a Windows 32-bit driver if you have MEPIS 32-bit edition and you MUST use a Windows 64-bit driver if you have MEPIS 64-bit edition. In general, Windows-XP drivers work much better than Vista drivers, so try the Windows-XP driver first. </p>
<p>Here are the steps you should take to get wireless working with Ndiswrapper:</p>
<ul><li>Open up MEPIS Network Assistant (<strong>KMenu --> Internet --> Connection</strong>), and click on the Troubleshooting tab.
<li>Click on Scan Hardware to make sure your device is being recognized by the system.
<li>Click on List Windows drivers, and look for one of the drivers there that is associated with your hardware. 
<li>If no driver is already associated, obtain the XP drivers for your card either from your legacy installation or from other sources (check the Wiki).
<li>Once you have placed the driver files (especially the *.inf and *.sys files) into a location on your computer, return to the Troubleshooting tab of the Network Assistant
<li>Using the Remove Driver button, remove the existing drivers one at a time until none are left.</li>
<li>Click on the Add Driver button, navigate to the location where you placed the XP driver files, highlight the file and click OK
<li>Use the Blacklist Driver button to prevent any associated Linux drivers from interfering.
<li>Click OK to close Network Assistant, and reboot your computer.
<li>If you are not connected when you reboot, go back to the Network Assistant and make sure your network ESSID is entered on the Wireless tab.  If not, enter it, click Apply, and restart the interface on the Interfaces tab.
<li>If you still have trouble, consult the Wiki or post the information described above in the last of the Basic Steps on MepisLovers forum.

<h1 id="section05-6-2">5.6.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Firewalls </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A firewall is a device or application used to filter data packets from incoming or outgoing network traffic, usually based upon the IP address or type of service (literally, the port number). Firewall configurations sometimes need to be adjusted if you add a new network service or change the port of an existing network service on your computer.</p>
<p> MEPIS Linux comes with a software firewall <strong>Guarddog</strong> preinstalled and configured, and it is recommended you use it as a safety precaution.  It is aimed at two groups of users: novice to intermediate users who are not experts in networking and security, and users who don't want the hassle of dealing with using scripts and parameters. See Links and Guides for more details. </p>
<br />

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>Most firewall programs available for MEPIS Linux are merely frontends for Netfilter/iptables, the network filtering module in newer Linux kernels. So, the real differences among different firewalls are the way the interface works and what options are available. Here are several alternatives: (See Links and Guides for more details)</p>

<h1 id="section05-6-3">5.6.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  File sharing </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you want to make files and directories available to other computers on your network, MEPIS Linux can handle a large variety of networking protocols to allow this. Many people accustomed to Windows may be confused by the variety of file sharing protocols and not understand why there are so many when Windows simply allows you to "share" files without much rigamarole. Being open, though, Linux allows you to choose the protocol that best suits your needs.</p>

<br />
<h2 id="s05-6-3_basic">Basic methods</h2>
<p>System-wide sharing is enabled by clicking <strong>KMenu --> Control Center --> Internet &amp; Network --> File Sharing</strong>.
Click on the bottom button Administrative Mode to select the protocol to use (Samba or NFS), folders to share, and users who may access
those folders.</p>

<ul> <!-- top level list -->
        <!--  *************************** SAMBA  ***************************  -->

<li>SAMBA:
<p>This is the protocol used by Windows machines (which they call SMB: &ldquo;Server Message Block&rdquo;). Samba is the most complete
solution to share files with Windows machines on your network without making changes to the windows machines. It also offers some other
services for interfacing with Windows networks, such as domain authentication, messaging services, and netbios name resolution.</p>
<ul> <!--sublist 1 -->
<li>Pros:
  
<ul> <!--sublist 1a -->
<li>Looks and acts just like a windows file share to clients.</li>
<li>Has lots of Windows networking features beyond file sharing (Domain authentication, Windows messaging service, netbios names, print
sharing, etc). </li>
<li>Very flexible and configurable.</li>

</ul> </li> <!--end sublist 1b -->

<li>Cons:
<ul><!-- sublist 1b -->
<li>Not the most stable option</li>
<li>Can be confusing to set up on the server side, because some of the terminology is different.</li>
<li>Security can be weird, since Windows clients are not all consistent in how they deal with security.</li>
<li>Not the best choice if you have relatively few (or no) Windows computers involved.</li>
</ul></li><!--end sublist 1b -->
</ul></li>  <!-- end sublist 1 -->

<!--  *************************** NFS  ***************************  -->
<li>NFS:
<p>This is the standard Unix protocol for sharing files. Many feel it is better  than Samba for sharing files, and it can be used with
Windows (2000 &amp; XP) machines if you install <em>Services for Unix</em> or a third-party NFS client on them. For more
information, see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.</p>
<ul>  <!-- sublist 2 -->
<li>Pros:
<ul><!--sublist 2a -->
<li>More mature and stable than Samba for Linux / Unix servers.</li>
<li>Simpler and less cumbersome than Samba.</li>

</ul></li> <!--end sublist 2a -->

<li>Cons:
<ul><!--sublist 2b -->
<li>Windows clients require extra configuration.</li>
<li>Terminology somewhat different from what Windows users are used to using.</li>
</ul></li><!--end sublist 2b -->
</ul></li><!-- end sublist 2 -->
</ul> <!-- end top level list -->

<br /><br />


<h2 id="s05-6-3_other">Other methods</h2>

<ul><!-- top level list -->
<!--  *************************** SSHFS  ***************************  -->
<li>SSHFS:
<p>This is a pretty new protocol that requires some additional installation on Mepis (at least for the client).  It is a mountable
filesystem protocol implemented using SSH, so it is encrypted and only requires that the server be running SSH. For more information, see
Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.</p>

<ul> <!-- sublist 1 -->
<li>Pros:
<ul>  <!-- sublist 1a -->
<li>Server only needs to be running SSHD: nothing else to set up.</li>
<li>All transmissions encrypted for security.</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist 1a -->

<li>Cons:
<ul>  <!-- sublist 1b -->
<li>Requires extra setup on the client -- modules need to be compiled, permissions set up, folders mounted, etc.</li>
<li>Hard to control what user has access to; anything they can access locally is available over the network.</li>
<li>Cannot setup "anonymous" shares. (?) (At least not without a major security compromise).</li>
<li>Forget about using this with Windows clients.</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 1b -->
</ul></li><!-- end sublist 1 -->

<!--  *************************** KDE  ***************************  -->
<li>KDE file server:
<p>This is a kicker applet which allows you to very easily share files over HTTP.  That is, you can access the files remotely using a
web-browser. This is best when you just want to make files available for download to any kind of client OS.  For more information, see
Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.</p>

<ul> <!-- sublist 2 -->
<li>Pros:
<ul> <!-- sublist 2a -->
<li>Extremely easy to set up.</li>
<li>Clients only need a web browser.</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 2b -->

<li>Cons:
<ul> <!-- sublist 2b -->
<li>Files can only be accessed through a web browser; shares can't be mounted or accessed through a file dialog.</li>
<li>Each share requires opening another port; may be extra work if you are running a firewall.</li>
<li>Requires KDE, so you can't use it on a "headless" server very well.</li>
</ul></li>  <!-- end sublist 2b -->
</ul></li>  <!-- end sublist 2 -->

<!--  *************************** FTP  ***************************  -->
<li>FTP
<p>This is a very old protocol that still enjoys common use and support.  It does not have all the features of other protocols and is
somewhat insecure, but is a good choice if you are going to share files out to the internet and you have a wide variety of client OS's. For
more information,  see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.</p>

<ul>  <!-- sublist 3 -->
<li>Pros
<ul>  <!-- sublist 3a -->
<li>Mature protocol, widely recognized.</li>
<li>Most OS's (including Windows) come with ftp clients built in. (On windows, IE is a passable ftp client).</li>
<li>Can be set up for anonymous sharing or secured sharing.</li>
</ul></li>  <!-- end sublist 3a -->

<li>Cons
<ul>  <!-- sublist 3b -->

<li>Not very secure for use on the internet (passwords sent in plain text).</li>
<li>Not very flexible for sharing out multiple unrelated folders.</li>
<li>Setup can be a bit of a challenge for newbies.</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 3b -->
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 3 -->

<!--  *************************** BIT-TORRENT  ***************************  -->
<li>BitTorrent
<p>BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol for distributing large amounts of data widely without the
original distributor incurring the entire costs of hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources.  See <a href="index.html#s08-01_bittorrent">Section 8.1: Bit-Torrent</a>.</p>

<h1 id="section05-6-4">5.6.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  VPN and Remote Desktop </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>VPN (Virtual Private Network) and remote desktop connections are carried out in MEPIS Linux by utilities available from the standard
repositories.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="s05-6-4_vpn">VPN</h2>
<p>Installing the package <strong>Kvpnc</strong> allows you to easily manage VPN connections in a graphic environment.  Follow these steps
to connect:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click on the application and supply the root password.</li>
<li>On the menu bar, click <strong>Profile --> New Profile</strong></li>
<li>Fill in the boxes on the screen as appropriate.   You can import your Cisco profile file, click <strong>Help --> Kvpnc Handbook</strong> for
details.</li>
<li>Save the profile, then click the Connect button.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>VPnc</strong> is a command-line VPN client installed with MEPIS Linux that is compatible with Cisco EasyVPN.  Open a
terminal, become root, and simply enter:</p>
<pre>
vpnc
</pre>

<p>For details, consult the man pages by entering <strong>man:vpnc</strong> in Konqueror's address bar.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-6-4_remote">Remote Desktop</h2>
<p>Remote desktop connections can be managed by installing the package <strong>Krdc</strong>. Follow these steps to connect:</p>

<ol>
<li>In the &ldquo;Remote desktop&rdquo; field type in the LAN IP of your remote server (PC) you want to control. For example: <strong>192.168.2.1:0</strong>   It
must have the &ldquo;:0&rdquo; following the IP address. This is because VNC, the actual application being used, can create several sessions
when connecting to a Linux box allowing you to type in :1, :2, etc. corresponding to the session number. For a Windows box you just need the
default session of :0.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Connect</strong>. </li>
<li>Once you click connect you need to choose the Connection Type, according to what speed of Internet connection you have.  You will then
be prompted for the VNC password you set on the remote server (PC).</li>
<li>You should now be connected to the remote server (PC) and able to control it as if you were physically present at the remote site. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>ALSA, which stands for Advanced Linux Sound Architecture, is a suite of hardware drivers, libraries and utilities that provides audio and
MIDI functionality for the Linux operating system.  For specific configuration needs, consult the ALSA Wiki in <a
href="index.html#s05-7_links">5.7: Links and Guides.</a></p>

<h2  id="s05-7_restricted">Restricted formats</h2>
<p>People wishing to play back video and audio files in proprietary formats will need to install these packages:</p>

<pre>
w32codecs
libdvdcss2
</pre>

<p>These are available through Synaptic after checking the box next to this repository (see <a href="index.html#section07-2">Section 7.2</a>):</p>
<pre>
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org lenny main
</pre>

<p>NOTE: The use of these packages is of questionable legality in some countries, so please check your local restrictions before installing.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-7_basic">Basic configuration</h2>
<p>Kmix is the recommended way to adjust the details of your sound.</p>
 
<ol>
<li>Open KMix by clicking <strong>KMenu --> Multimedia --> KMix</strong>, or by clicking the speaker icon in the system tray (right side of kicker) and clicking on <strong>Mixer</strong>.</li> 
<li>On the Output tab, make sure the Master volume (on the far left) is turned up.</li> 
<li>Also, make sure PCM is turned up (the control with the blue squiggly line above it).</li> 
<li>Make sure that the little round buttons (green lights) above these slider controls are on (bright green).</li>  
<li>On the Input tab, check that the channels you need (CD, etc.) are not muted. The mute buttons look like green LEDs.</li>  
<li>On the menu bar click <strong>Settings --> Configure Kmix</strong> and make certain that <strong>Restore volumes on login</strong> is
checked.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: you cannot play an audio CD by clicking on the CD-ROM icon on the desktop.  You must use an installed player (see <a href="index.html#section08-02">Section 8.2: Multimedia</a>).</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-7_kscd">Fixing KsCD</h2>
<p>KsCD is KDE's lightweight CD player for MEPIS Linux, but it needs to be configured in order produce sound:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --> Multimedia --> KsCD</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Extras --> Configure KsCD...</strong></li>
<li>Highlight CD Player</li>
<li>In the CD-ROM Device box on the right, check "Use direct digital playback"</li>
<li>Click OK, returning you to the KsCD main screen.</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-7_system">System sounds</h2>
<p>You can control KDE system-wide sound settings by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --> Control Center --> Sound &amp; Multimedia</strong></li>
<li>Click on any topic to change the settings</li>
</ol>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s05-7_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>You can set up your sound driver by opening a terminal, becoming root, and typing:</p>
<pre>alsaconf</pre>
<p>This will start an automatic process to discover your sound card and install the correct driver.</p>

<p>If troubles still persist, you can follow a step-by-step procedure.  To start, you will need to know what sound card you have.  Open a terminal by clicking <strong>KMenu --> System -->
Konsole</strong>, and enter this line:</p>
<pre>
lspci | grep -i audio
</pre>

<p>This command asks that all devices be listed that contain the word &ldquo;audio&rdquo; in their description, and the output will tell
you your card manufacturer and model. Here is an example of output:</p>
<pre>
0000:00:1f.5 Multimedia audio controller: Intel Corporation 82801EB/ER (ICH5/ICH5R)
</pre>

<p>With this information, you can use the MEPIS Wiki sound driver
database found under Links and Guides to track down more information and help, or turn to other resources linked below.  In rare cases, you may have to load a module for
your card following the directions linked below.</p>

<p>NOTE: Many of the drivers do not include the <strong>snd-</strong> prefix; you will need to add that to get the actual module name.</p>

<h1 id="section05-8">5.8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bluetooth</h1>
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Bluetooth is enabled in MEPIS Linux by default through the kernel, but no desktop tools are included for the user.  Bluetooth tools are easily available through Synaptic (see <a href="index.html#section07-2">7.2:&nbsp; Synaptic Software Package Manager</a>) by installing the package:</p>
<pre>kdebluetooth</pre>
<p>Once this package is installed, you will find a whole host of tools, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>kbluetooth &mdash; a tray applet to handle incoming inquiries</li>
<li>kbtobexclient &mdash; to send files via bluetooth</li>
<li>kbluemon &mdash; a bluetooth monitor</li>
<li>kinputwizard &mdash; a wizard to configure Input Devices</li>
<li>kbluelock &mdash; a bluetooth screen locker</li>
</ul>
<p>These tools can be found most easily by right-clicking the Bluetooth icon on the right side of the panel, though you can also hunt around KMenu for them.</p>

<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s05-8_config">Configuration</h2>
<p>An easy way to configure Bluetooth for devices such as a keyboard or a mouse is to right-click the <strong>Bluetooth icon --> Configuration --> Input Devices...</strong>.  In the dialogue box that pops up you will see what has already been configured.  You can add a new device by clicking on the button labelled Add New Devices, which initiates a search.</p>
<p>You can also pair your computer with devices so that they automatically link. Initiate the request for pairing on your device (PDA, phone, etc.) and provide some code word (e.g., 1234), then enter the same code on the host computer.  If you are not quick enough, you will get an error message and have to start again.  Manage paired devices by right-clicking the <strong>Bluetooth icon --> Configuration --> Paired/Trusted Devices...</strong>.  There is a Help file associated with kdebluetooth, but it is currently out of date.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Although MEPIS Linux offers a complete set of graphical tools for installing, configuring, and using your system, the command line (also called the console, terminal, BASH, or shell) is still a useful and at times indispensible tool.  Here are some common uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch a GUI application to see its error output.</li>
<li>Speed up system administration tasks.</li>
<li>Configure or install advanced software applications.</li>
<li>Execute multiple tasks quickly and easily.</li>
<li>Troubleshoot hardware devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>The default program to run a terminal in a  MEPIS Linux 8.0 KDE desktop window is <strong>Konsole</strong>, which can be found at <strong>KMenu --> System --> Terminal Program (Konsole)</strong>.</p>

<p>Though console commands can be fairly complex, understanding the command line is just a matter of putting together simple things.  To see
how easy it can be, open Konsole and try a few basic commands. This will all make more sense if you do it as a tutorial exercise rather
 than just reading it.  Let's start with a simple command: <strong>ls</strong>, which lists the contents of a directory. The basic command
lists the contents of whatever directory you are currently in:</p>
<pre>
ls
</pre>

<p>That's a useful command, but it's just a few short columns of names printed across the screen. Suppose we want more information on the files in this directory. We can add a <strong>switch</strong> to the command to make it print out more information.  A <strong>switch</strong> is a modifier we append to a command to change its behavior.  In this case, the switch we want is:</p>

<pre>
ls -l
</pre>

<p>As you can see on your own screen if you are following along, this switch provides more detailed information on the files in any
directory.  Of course, we might want to see the contents of another directory (without going there first).  To do this, we add an
<strong>argument</strong> to the command, specifying which file we want to look at.  An <strong>argument</strong> is a value or reference we add
to a command to target its operation.  In this case:</p>

<pre>
ls -l /usr/bin/
</pre>

<p>By giving an argument of <strong>/usr/bin</strong>, we can list the contents of that directory, rather than the one where we currently
are.</p>

<p>There are a lot of files in <strong>/usr/bin</strong>!  It would be nice if we could filter this output so that only entries that
contained, say, the word "fire" would be listed.  We can do this by <strong>piping</strong> the output of the <em>ls</em> command into another
command, <strong>grep</strong>.  The <strong>pipe</strong>, or &ldquo;|&rdquo; character, is used to send the output of one command to the input of
another.</p>
<p>The command <strong>grep</strong> searches for the pattern you give it and returns all matches, so piping the output of the previous
command to it filters the output.</p>

<pre>
ls -l /usr/bin/ &#124; grep fire
</pre>
<p>Thanks to <em>grep</em>, we only see the lines of the output that contain the word "fire".  Finally, suppose we want these results saved
in a text file for use at a later time?</p>

<p>When we issue commands, the output is usually directed to the console display; but we can
<em>redirect</em> this output somewhere else, such as to a file, using the <strong>&gt;</strong> (redirect) symbol:</p>
<pre>
ls -l /usr/bin/ &#124; grep fire > FilesOfFire.txt
</pre>
<p>This command now instructs your computer to make a detailed list of all the files that contain the word "fire" and to create a text file containing that list.  As you can see, the console can be used to perform complex tasks very easily by joining simple commands together in different ways.</p>

<p>Here is a list of rudimentary terminal commands.  For a complete reference, see the Links and Guides section. </p>
<table>
<tr><th colspan = "2">Filesystem navigation</th></tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>cd /usr/share</strong></td>
<td>Changes current directory to the given path: &ldquo;/usr/share&rdquo;.  With no argument, <strong>cd</strong> takes you to your home
directory. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>pwd</strong> </td>
<td>Prints the current working directory path</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>ls</strong></td><td>Lists the contents of the current directory.  Use the <strong>-a</strong> switch to show hidden files as well, and the <strong>-l</strong> switch to show details on all files.  Often combined with other terms: <strong>lsusb</strong> lists all the usb devices,
<strong>lsmod</strong> all the modules, etc.<br /></td>
</tr>

<tr><th colspan = "2">File management</th></tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>cp source.file destination.file</strong></td>
<td>Copy a file to another filename or location.  Use the <strong>-R</strong> switch ("recursive") to copy entire directories.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>mv source.file destination.file</strong></td>
<td>Move a file or directory from one location to another.  Also used to rename files or
directories and to make a backup, for example before changing a critical file such as <strong>xorg.conf</strong>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>rm deleteme.file</strong></td>
<td>Delete a file.  Use the <strong>-R</strong> switch to delete a directory, and the <strong>-f</strong> switch ("force") if you don't want to
be prompted to confirm each deletion.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>cat file.txt</strong></td>
<td>Prints the contents of a file on the screen.  Only use on text files.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>grep</strong></td>
<td>Find a given string of characters in a given piece of text, and print the entire line it was on.  Usually used
with a pipe, e.g. <strong>cat somefile.txt &#124; grep <em>somestring</em></strong> will display the line from somefile.txt that contains &rdquo;somestring&rdquo;.  To find a network usb card, for instance, you could type: <strong>lsusb &#124; grep network</strong>. The grep command is case sensitive by default, use the <strong>-i</strong> switch to make it case-insensitive.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>most</strong></td>
<td>More sophisticated file viewer, which features one screenful at a time, up and down scrolling, text searching, line numbers, and other things.  Often used in a pipe, for instance <strong>cat somefile.txt &#124; most</strong>. NOTE: this replaces <strong>less</strong> as the default pager in MEPIS Linux 8.0.</td>
</tr>

<tr><th colspan = "2">Symbols</th></tr>

<tr>
<td> <strong> &#124; </strong> </td>
<td>The pipe symbol, used to send the output of one command into the input of another.</td>

<h2 id="s06-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>For most new Linux users, the command line is mainly used as a troubleshooting tool.  Terminal commands give quick, detailed information that can be easily pasted into a forum post, search box, or email when seeking help on the web.  Here are some common troubleshooting commands. Some of them may not output information, or not as much information unless you are <a href="index.html#s12-1_rootuser " class="spterm"  title="see glossary for &ldquo;root user&rdquo;">logged in as root</a>.</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>lspci</strong></td>
<td>Shows a quick summary of detected internal hardware devices.  If a devices shows as <em>unknown</em>, you usually have
a driver issue.  The <strong>-v</strong> switch causes more detailed information to be displayed.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>lsusb</strong></td>
<td>Lists attached usb devices.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>dmesg</strong></td>
<td>Shows the system log for the current session (i.e. since you last booted).   The output is quite long, and
usually this is piped through <strong>grep</strong>, <strong>less</strong> (similar to <strong>most</strong>) or <strong>tail</strong> (to see what happened most recently). 
For example, to find potential errors related to your network hardware, try <strong>dmesg &#124; grep -i net</strong>.</td>

</table>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s06-1_doc">Accessing documentation for commands</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Many commands will print out a simple "usage information" message when you use the &ldquo;--help&rdquo; or &ldquo;-h&rdquo; switch.  This can be helpful for quickly recalling the syntax of a command. For example:
<pre>
cp --help
</pre>
</li>
<li>For more detailed information on how to use a command, consult the command's <strong>man page</strong>.   Short for &#8220;manual,&#8221; man pages typically contain detailed information about switches, arguments, and sometimes the inner workings of a command.  Even GUI programs often have man pages, detailing available command line options.
</li>
<li> Manual pages are conveniently viewed in Konqueror by typing <strong>man:commandname</strong>
into the address bar.  In addition, by simply typing <strong>man:/</strong> into Konqueror,  you can browse the entire collection of man
pages installed by MEPIS.
</li>

<li>The man page may also be read at the console with the command <strong>man <em>commandname</em></strong>.  By default, man pages are displayed
in the terminal's <strong>most</strong> pager, meaning that only one screenful of the file is displayed at a time.
 Keep these tricks in mind to navigate the resulting screen:
<ul> <!-- sublist -->
<li>The space bar advances the screen.</li>
<li>The letter <strong>b</strong> moves the screen backward.</li>
<li>The letter <strong>q</strong> exits the help document.</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist -->

<h1 id="section07-1">7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software Management</h1>

<h2>7.1: Introduction</h2>

<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>Synaptic is the recommended method for beginners to manipulate software packages, although other methods are also available and may be
required for certain situations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href ="index.html#section07-2">7.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synaptic Package Manager</a></li>
<li><a href= "index.html#section07-3">7.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other methods</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="s07-1_packages" >Packages</h3>
<p>Installing, removing, and upgrading software on MEPIS is accomplished through the Advanced Package Tool (<strong>APT</strong>) system.   Software
is provided in the form of a <strong>package</strong>, a discrete, non-executable bundle of data that includes instructions for your package manager
about installation.  They are stored on servers called <strong>repositories</strong>, and can be browsed, downloaded, and installed through special
client software called a <strong>package manager</strong>.  The recommended package manager for MEPIS is Synaptic (see <a href="index.html#section07-2"> Section 7.2</a>), though the graphical utility KPackage and the command-line utility apt-get are also included for those who prefer them (see <a href= "index.html#section07-3"> Section 7.3</a>).</p>

<p>The majority of packages have one or more <strong>dependencies</strong>, meaning that they have one or more packages that must also be
installed in order for them to work.  The APT system is designed to automatically handle dependencies for you; in other words, when you
try to install a package whose dependencies aren't already installed, your APT package manager will automatically mark those dependencies
for installation as well.</p>


<br />

<h3 id="s07-1_repo">Repositories</h3>
<p>APT <a href="index.html#s12-1_repo" class="spterm"  title="click to go to the Glossary">repositories (repos)</a> are much more
than just web sites with downloadable software.  The packages on repository sites are specially organized and indexed to be accessed through
a <a href="index.html#s12-1_package-man" class="spterm"  title="click to go to the Glossary">package manager,</a> rather
than browsed directly. MEPIS Linux 8.0 comes with a set of enabled repositories that offer you both security and choice.  If you are new to
MEPIS (and especially if you are new to Linux), it is recommended that in general you stick with the default repositories at first, with the exception of the multimedia repository that you will need to enable for proprietary-format codecs  (see <a href="index.html#section08-02">Section 8.2</a>). </p>

<p>For security reasons, these repositories are digitally signed, meaning that packages are authenticated with an encryption key to make sure they are authentic. If you install packages from non-Debian repos without the key, you will get a warning that they could not be authenticated.  To get rid of this warning and make sure your installations are secure, you need to install any keys not installed by default; see if the repo contains a keyring package, or check its home page for instructions on adding the key. Most repositories should have a <em>keyring</em> package which installs the necessary keys (search <em>keyring</em> in Synaptic).  Here are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>gnome-keyring </li>
<li>debian-archive-keyring </li>
<li>debian-multimedia-keyring </li>
</ul>

<p>The MEPIS Community has its own repository of packages that it builds and maintains.  These packages are distinct from official MEPIS packages, and typically have been <a href="index.html#s12-1_backport" class="spterm" id="backport" title="click to go to the Glossary">backported</a> from Debian versions that are still in testing or even experimental.  To find out more about what is available, who the packagers are, and even how to get involved, follow the MEPIS Community Package Project link below.</p>

<p>Repositories are most easily added, removed, or edited through Synaptic, though they can also be altered by hand by editing the file <strong>/etc/atp/sources.list</strong> in a root terminal. In Synaptic, click <strong>Settings --> Repositories</strong>, then click the button New and add the information.  Here, for instance, is how the settings look for the MEPIS Community repo:</p>
<img src="grafx/CommRepoSyn_small.png" alt="Synaptic community repo" width="400" height="93" />

<p>Some repositories carry special labels:  </p>
<ul>
<li><u>contrib</u>, which depend on or are accessory to non-free packages.</li>
<li><u>non-free</u>, which do not meet the Debian free software guidelines (DFSG).</li>
<li><u>security</u>, which contains security-related updates only.</li> 
<li><u>backports</u>, which contains packages from newer versions of Debian that have been backwards compiled for Debian 5.0 
(&ldquo;Lenny,&rdquo; the version SimplyMEPIS 8.0 is built with) to keep your OS up-to-date.</li>
<li><u>mepis</u>, which contains the special packages that make MEPIS what it is.</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />


<h2 id="s07-1_tips">Tips</h2>
<ul><li>Be sure to have only one package manager open at a time, or you will get an error message.</li>
<li>MEPIS Linux 8.0 is binary-compatible with DEBIAN Lenny (codename for the current stable release).  This means that software compiled to run on Lenny should be able to be run without
modification on MEPIS Linux 8.0.  Adding repositories or installing packages designed for newer versions of Debian, Ubuntu, or Ubuntu
derivatives (including SimplyMEPIS 6.x) may cause system instability.
</li>

<li>In addition to dependencies, packages can also specify <em>suggests</em> and <em>recommends</em>.  <strong>Recommends</strong>, unlike
&ldquo;dependencies,&rdquo; are not absolutely required, but should be installed along with the package in most circumstances.
<strong>Suggests</strong> are packages that enhance or compliment the package in question, but are in no way required.  To see and/or mark
suggested or recommended packages, right-click the package and select <strong>mark suggested for install</strong> or <strong>mark
recommended for install</strong>, respectively.
</li>
<li>MEPIS Linux includes a special desktop applet called <strong>APT-Notify</strong>, which is already in the kicker-bar of the
default desktop. Normally it appears as an empty yellow-brown box, but when updates are available a green arrow will appear on the box and
the number of available updates will appear below it.  Click the icon to open Synaptic, click Mark all upgrades, and run the updates.
</li>

<li>If you plan to install software using methods other than APT (for instance, to get a newer version), make sure you <em>purge</em> any
versions that have been installed using Synaptic (right-click, <strong>Mark for Complete Removal</strong>) or apt-get in a terminal (type
<strong>dpkg --help</strong> for information).  Since non-repository installations often put files in different locations than repository
installations, failing to remove the repository version can cause two conflicting versions to be installed side-by-side.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-1_troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul>
<li><u>Should you uninstall?</u>:  Occasionally, conflicts in package dependencies can cause the APT system to require the uninstallation of  a
large number of important packages in order to install some other package.  This is rare with the default configuration, but becomes
increasingly likely as you add unsupported repositories.  <strong>BE VERY ATTENTIVE</strong> whenever installing a package would require
that others be removed!  If a large number of packages are going to be removed, you may want to investigate another method of installing
this application.
</li>
<li><u>Should you keep?</u>:  When upgrading, you will often be informed that a new configuration file is available for a certain package,  and be asked
whether you want to install the new version (a.k.a. &ldquo;the package maintainer's version&rdquo;) or keep your current version.  The
safest answer to this question is usually <strong>keep the current version</strong> (<strong>N</strong>), which is also the default choice. 
If the package in question is from a MEPIS Linux repository, however, it is recommended that you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; <strong>(Y)</strong> instead.

<h1 id="section07-2">7.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synaptic Software Package Manager</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Synaptic is a friendly, easy-to-use frontend (GUI) to the APT <a href="index.html#s12-1_package-man" class="spterm" 
title="click to go to the Glossary"> package management </a> system.  It is a graphical tool which allows you to install,
remove, upgrade, or get information on all the software packages available in the online repositories on your repository list
(<strong>/etc/apt/sources.list</strong>).  Synaptic can be launched from <strong>KMenu --> System --> Package Manager (Synaptic Package
Manager)</strong>, or you can simply click on the <strong>APT Notify</strong> icon in Kicker, which looks like an open box.  Note that your root
password is required in order to install or remove software; and naturally, if you want to use the online repositories (as opposed to the CD
or DVD), you will need to be connected to the Internet.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="s07-2_installing">Installing new software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Here are the basic steps for installing software in Synaptic:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.
</li>
<li>Hit the <strong>Reload</strong> button.  This button causes Synaptic to contact the online repository servers and download a new
<em>index</em> file with information on what packages are available, what versions they are, and what other packages are required for them
to be installed.
</li>
<li>If you already know the name of the package you are looking for, just click in the pane on the right and start typing, and Synaptic will incrementally search for what you type. 
</li> 
<li>If you don't know the package's name, use the <strong>Search</strong> button to locate software based on name or keywords.  This is one of Synaptic's greatest advantages over other methods.
</li>
<li>Alternatively, click the <strong>Sections</strong> button on the bottom left and browse through the one that interests you (Editors, Games and Amusement, Utilities, etc.).  You will see a description of each package in the bottom pane, and can use the tabs to discover more information about it.
</li>
<li>Click the empty box next to it and select <strong>Mark for Installation</strong>.  If the package has dependencies, you will be notified and they will automatically be marked for installation as well.  You can also just double-click the package if it is the only one you are installing.
</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to begin the installation.  You will see a warning message &#8220;You are about to install software that can't be authenticated!&#8221; that you can safely ignore.
</li>  
<li>There may be additional steps: just follow the prompts as you receive them until the installation completes.
</li>
<li>Occasionally, packages will fail to install because their install scripts fail one or more <em>safety
checks;</em> for instance, a package might try to overwrite a file that is part of another package, or require downgrading another package
due to dependencies.  If you have an install or upgrade that is stuck on one of these errors, it is called a <em>broken package</em>.  To fix this, click on the <strong>Custom</strong> button on the bottom of the left panel, then the entry <em>Broken.</em>  Highlight the package and try first to fix the problem by clicking <strong>Edit --> Fix Broken Packages</strong>.  If that is not successful, then right-click the package to uninstall it.
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-2_upgrading">Upgrading software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Synaptic enables you to quickly and conveniently keep your system up-to-date.</p>  

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.
</li> 
<li>Synaptic will inform you if any packages are upgradeable by marking them with a star.  You can also click the <strong>Status</strong> button on the bottom left and select the <em>Installed (upgradeable)</em> section in the left pane to see all the upgradeable packages installed on your system.
</li>  
<li>Click the <strong>Mark All Upgrades</strong> button to select all of these packages for upgrade, or click on the packages one-by-one to individually select upgrades. 
</li> 
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> to begin the upgrade, ignoring the warning message.  As the installation process begins, you have the option of watching the details in a terminal within Synaptic.
</li>
<li>With some package upgrades, you may be asked to confirm a dialog, enter configuration information, or decide whether or not to
overwrite a configuration file you have altered.  Pay attention here, and follow the prompts until the upgrade completes.
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="s07-2_downgrading">Downgrading software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may want to downgrade an application to an older version, for instance because of problems that arose with the new one.  This is easy to do in Synaptic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.</li>
<li>Click on Installed in the panel on the left, then find and highlight the package you want to downgrade in the panel on the right</li>
<li>On the menu bar, click <strong>Package --> Force version...</strong></li>
<li>Select from the available versions on the pull-down list</li>
<li>Click Force Version, then install in the usual manner.</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-2_pinning">Pinning software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may want to <em>pin</em> an application to a specific version to keep it from being upgraded in order to avoid problems with more recent ones.  This is easy to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic, supply the root password, and click Reload.
</li>
<li>Click on Installed in the panel on the left, then find and highlight the package you want to pin in the panel on the right.
</li>
<li>On the menu bar, click <strong>Package --> Lock version...</strong>
</li>
<li>Synaptic will highlight the package in red and add a lock icon to the first column.
</li>
<li>To unlock, highlight the package again and click Package --> Lock version (which will have a check mark).
</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: this pinning only affects the application Synaptic, not the actual list of application versions used by Apt, and will not work if you later use another upgrade means.  For a universal pinning method, follow the example linked below.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-2_removing">Removing software with Synaptic</h2>
<p>Removing software from your system with Synaptic seems as straightforward as installing, but there is more to it than meets the eye:</p> 
 
<ul>
<li>To remove a package, simply right-click it and select <strong>Mark for Removal</strong> or <strong>Mark for Complete Removal</strong>.

<ul> <!-- sublist -->
<li><strong>Removal</strong> uninstalls the software, but leaves configuration files in case you want to keep your settings.
</li>  
<li><strong>Complete Removal</strong> removes the software and the configuration files as well (this is known as <em>purging</em> a package).
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist -->

<li>When you have other programs that depend on the package being removed, those packages will have to be removed as well.   This usually happens when you remove software libraries (packages starting with &ldquo;lib&rdquo;), services, or command-line applications that serve as  <a
href="index.html#s12-1_backend" class="spterm"  title="program you don't directly run, but access via a frontend"> back-ends</a> to other
applications.  <em>Make sure you read carefully</em> the summary Synaptic gives you before clicking <strong>OK</strong>.
</li>
<li>Removing large applications that are composed of many packages can bring complications.   Many times these packages are installed using
a <strong>meta-package</strong>, which is an empty package that simply depends on all the packages you need for the application.  The best way to
remove a complicated package like this is to inspect the dependency list for the meta-package, and remove the packages listed there.  Take
care, however, that you don't uninstall a dependency of another application you want to keep!
</li>

<p>The software packages installed through Synaptic (and APT behind it) are in a format called <em>deb</em> (short for &ldquo;Debian&rdquo;,
the Linux distribution that devised APT). You can manually install deb packages using the graphical tool <strong>Kpackage</strong> or
the command-line tool <strong>dpkg</strong>.</p>
<p>NOTE: It is also possible to carry out other Synaptic functions with these tools: consult the documentation listed below.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-3_kpackage">Installing .deb files with Kpackage</h2>
<ol>
<li>Double-click the deb package you want to install.  Kpackage will open the install dialog.  You can also click  <strong>KMenu --> System
--> More Applications --> Package Manager (Kpackage)</strong>, and select the package manually.</li>

<li>Make sure <strong>Check Dependencies</strong> and<strong> Check Conflicts</strong> are both marked. By default in MEPIS Linux 8.0, the
box <strong>Allow Downgrades</strong> is also checked, allowing APT to select a more compatible version of a package, if necessary. Click
<strong>Install.</strong></li>

<li>You will be prompted for your root password.  Enter it to proceed.</li>

<li>Kpackage will attempt to install the package, posting the results in the right pane.   If you see <strong>result=0</strong> at the end,
it means the install was successful.</li>

<li>If you receive errors such as <strong>result=1</strong> indicating that the package could not install, return to the main panel, and click <strong>Special --> APT: Debian --> Fixup</strong>. If it is possible, APT will try to fix the problems.  If that fails, then delete the package and consult the MEPIS community forums or the MEPIS Wiki for more information (see <a href="index.html#section11-1">Section 11: More resources</a>).</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-3_dpkg">Installing deb files with dpkg</h2>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; dpkg is a LOCAL installer/de-installer package. It does not work over the internet like synaptic or kpackage or apt-get. Dpkg can only install a .deb that has already been downloaded to the system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Konsole from <strong>KMenu --> System --> Terminal Program (Konsole)</strong>.   Become root using the <strong>su</strong> command and entering the root password when prompted.</li>
<li>Use the <strong>cd</strong> command to change to the directory containing your downloaded .deb file(s).  (Sometimes it is easier to first navigate to the directory containing the deb file(s), hit F4 to open a terminal, and change to root.)
<br /></li>

<li>Install the package with the command (substituting the real package name, of course): 
<pre>
dpkg -i packagename.deb
</pre>
If you are installing multiple packages at the same time, you can do it all at once using:
<pre>
dpkg -i *.deb
</pre> 
NOTE: In a shell command, the asterisk is a <em>wild card</em> in the argument. In this case it will cause the program to apply the command to
any file whose name ends with &ldquo;.deb&rdquo;.</li>

<li>If required dependencies are not installed on your system already, you will get <em>unmet dependencies errors</em> as
<strong>dpkg</strong> does not automatically take care of them.  To correct these errors and finish the installation, run
<pre>
apt-get -f install
</pre>
Apt-get will attempt to rectify the situation by either installing the needed dependencies (if they are available from
the repositories), or removing your .deb files (if the dependencies cannot be installed).
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s07-3_more">More install methods</h2>
<p>Sooner or later some software that you want to install will not be available in the repositories and you  may need to use other
installation methods.  These methods include: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>RPM packages:</strong> Some distributions of Linux use the RPM packaging system (short for RedHat Package Manager, developed by
RedHat Linux. RPM packages are similar to <em>deb</em> packages in many ways, and there is a command-line program available from MEPIS Linux to
convert RPM packages to <em>debs</em> called <strong>alien</strong>.   Alien does not come installed with MEPIS Linux 8.0, but is available
from the default repositories.
<br />
After you have installed alien on your system, you can use it to install an rpm package with this command (as root): 
<pre>
alien -i packagename.rpm
</pre>  
That will place a deb file with the same name in the location of the rpm file that you can then install as described above. For more detailed information on alien, see the internet version of its <em>man page</em>  in the Links and Guides section at the bottom of
this page.
</li>

<li id="s07-3_source">
<strong>Source code:</strong> Any open-source program can be compiled from the programmer's original source code if there is no other option. In ideal circumstances, this is actually a pretty simple operation, but sometimes you can run into errors that require a little more skill to sort through. Source is usually distributed as a <em>tarball</em> (tar.gz or tar.bz2 file).  See the Links and Guides section for a tutorial on compiling programs.
</li>

<li>
<strong>Miscellaneous:</strong> Many software developers package software in their own custom ways, usually  distributed as tarballs or zip files. They may contain setup scripts, ready-to-run binaries, or binary installer programs similar to Windows &ldquo;setup.exe&rdquo; programs. In Linux, such programs often end in &ldquo;.bin&rdquo;.  GoogleEarth, for example, is often distributed this way.  When in doubt, consult the installation instructions provided with the software.  If you have to compile a package, consult the MEPIS Wiki article below.

<h2 id="s08-01_bluetooth">Bluetooth</h2>
<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8: Bluetooth</a></em></p>
<p>Bluetooth provides a means to connect and exchange information between personal devices such as mobile phones, laptops,  digital cameras, etc., over a secure short-range radio frequency.  Installing <strong>kdebluetooth</strong> through the repos provides many basic tools (see <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8</a>) that are available by right-clicking the Bluetooth icon on the right side of the Kicker panel and are mostly self-explanatory.</p>

<h3>Object transfer</h3>
<p>Various applications can use Bluetooth to pass objects (files, pictures, vCal entries, vCards, etc.) between devices, though some work better than others and success depends a lot on the particular device.  All rely on the Object Exchange protocol (OBEX), a kind of binary HTTP optimized for ad-hoc wireless links that is built in on many devices like PDAs and mobile phones.</p>

<p>OBEX Client (kbtobexclient) is installed with kdebluetooth, and easily used from the host computer or the device:</p>

<ul> <!-- start  primary list-->
<li>From the host computer:
<ul> <!-- start sub-list-->
<li>Pair the device with the host computer (see <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8</a>) if not already done.
</li>
<li>Right-click the Bluetooth icon and select <strong>Send file...</strong>.
</li> 
<li>A screen will open up, showing your home directory in the upper half, and  in the lower half any Bluetooth devices it has found after searching.
</li>  
<li>Locate and drag any file(s) you want to transfer to the lower right portion of the screen, click on the device name if necessary, and click <strong>Send</strong>. 
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sub-list-->

<li>From the device:
<ul> <!-- start sub-list-->
<li>Pair the device with the host computer (see <a href="index.html#section05-8">Section 5.8</a>) if not already done.
</li>
<li>Before initiating transfer, click on the Bluetooth icon on the host computer, then on the device name to connect them.  You will see a pop-up notification that the connection has been made.
</li>
<li>Initiate transfer on the device by the appropriate means.  For example, on a Palm PDA, you navigate to the object you want to transfer, tap to highlight it, click Send, and select Bluetooth.
</li>
<li>Look for a dialog box, perhaps minimalized, on the host computer.
</li>
<li>Click the pull-down menu on the dialog box (below the field with the object(s) to transfer), and select to allow transfer automatically.  Then click OK to transfer the object, and select the location where you want it.

<li>
<strong>Konqueror</strong> has a built in previewer for images with adjustable thumbnail sizes. Click <strong>View --&gt; Icon View</strong> to show files as thumbnails, and <strong>View --&gt; Icon Size</strong> to select the size you want. When you open a folder that contains photos and images with the Konqueror file browser, the images are displayed as thumbnails if they are within the allowed file size, which by default is less than 2Mb, good for most 3.2 megapixel images.
<br />
To increase the file size limit, click on the <strong>Settings --&gt; Configure Konqueror</strong> and select the <strong>Previews &amp; Meta-Data</strong> in the left panel and type in a value or adjust the slider on the right for the Maximum file size. A good value for 5 megapixel photos is ~2.6MB.

<h2 id="s08-06_files">Folders and Files</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 comes with a powerful graphical program to manage files and folders called Konqueror, the web
browser, file manager and file viewer for KDE. There is also a command-line program available from the repos called Midnight Commander that uses the entire terminal screen.
Each has its advantages, depending on your preferences and the task you need to accomplish.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Konqueror:&nbsp;</b>  Konqueror as a File Manager is reached most easily by clicking the Documents icon on the desktop or the

<h2 id="s08-07_findfile">Finding files and folders</h2>

<p>A number of powerful means of finding files or folders, both graphical and command-line, are available for MEPIS Linux 8.0.</p>
<h4>GUI:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>KFind:&nbsp;</strong> This graphical search program can be reached by clicking <strong>KMenu --&gt; Find Files or Folders
(KFinder)</strong>.  You can search by name, location, contents or properties.
<br />
KFind handbook: open the application and click the Help button.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>CLI:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>locate:&nbsp;</strong> A command-line tool that can be installed from the repos.  For each given pattern, <strong>locate</strong> searches one or more databases of file names and displays the ones that contain the pattern. For example, typing:
<pre>
locate firefox
</pre>
will return an extremely long list with every single file that has the word &ldquo;firefox&rdquo; in its name or in its path. This command is best used when the <em>exact</em> file name is known.

</li>

<li>
<strong>whereis:&nbsp;</strong> Another command-line tool.  For each given pattern, <strong>whereis</strong> searches one or more databases of file names and displays the file names that contain the pattern, but it ignores paths so the return list is much shorter. For example, typing:
<pre>
whereis firefox
</pre> 
will return a much shorter list something like this: 
<pre>
firefox: /usr/bin/firefox /etc/firefox /usr/lib/firefox /usr/X11R6/bin/firefox

<li>
<strong>which:</strong> Another command-line tool.  For the given pattern, <strong>which</strong> attempts to identify the
executable. For example, typing:
<pre>
which firefox
</pre>

will return just one file:

<h4>Detailed list</h4>
<p>You can get more detailed information using a command-line program that comes pre-installed with MEPIS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Open a terminal and type <a class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_rootuser " title="see Glossary for &ldquo;root user&rdquo;">as root:</a> <strong>hwinfo</strong> to see a detailed list of hardware. If you run the command as an ordinary user, you may get less information.
</li>

<li>You can copy and paste this list into a document. Or you can redirect the output to a plain text document by typing this as root:

<h2  id="s08-07_kill">Killing runaway programs</h2>
<p>When a program refuses to end, you can kill it in a number of ways.  Here are two of the most common:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Desktop:&nbsp;</strong>
<ul><!-- sublist -->
<li>
Press <strong>Ctrl-Esc</strong>, which brings up KDE System Guard.  Locate the program you want to stop by scrolling through the list or using the search box, highlight it, and click Kill.
</li>
<li>
Press <strong>Ctrl-Alt-Esc</strong> to change the cursor into a skull and crossbones.  Click on any open program to kill it. This xkill
program can also be launched from the command line:
<pre>
xkill
</pre>
</li>
</ul></li><!-- end sublist -->

<li>
<strong>Terminal:&nbsp;</strong>: Press <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>, which will usually stop a program you started in a terminal
session.

</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2 id="s08-07_symlink">Symbolic links</h2>
<p>A symbolic link (also soft link or symlink) is a special kind of file that points to another file,  much like a shortcut in Windows or an
alias in Macintosh. A symbolic link does not contain any actual data (as a hard link does), it just points to another file somewhere in the
system. </p>
<p>There are two ways to create a symlink: Konqueror or the command line.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Konqueror:&nbsp;</strong>  Navigate to the file or folder (target of the link) that you want to use under another name, then  open another window of Konqueror to navigate to where you want the symlink to be located.  Drag the target to the symlink location.  A box will open with choices to <strong>Move Here, Copy Here,</strong> or <strong>Link Here.</strong> Select <strong>Link Here</strong>  and you're done! Name it however you want, and you have a symbolic link to the target file &mdash;which is still in its original location.</li>

<li>
<strong>Command line:</strong>   Open a terminal and type:
<pre>
ln -s TargetFile LinkName
</pre>
Be sure to include full path as well as file/folder names. The <strong>-s</strong> switch indicates that a symbolic link and not a hard link (that points directly to data) is being created.

<!-- ########################### SECTION 08.08  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section08-08">8.8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Good practices </h1>

<p>This section covers the good basic practices that MEPIS Linux 8.0 users should follow to keep their system efficient and secure. </p>

<h2 id="s08-08_backup">Backup</h2>
<p>The most important practice is to back up your data and configuration files regularly, a process that is easy in MEPIS Linux.  It is highly recommended that you back up to a different drive than the one your data is on! You can buy a new storage device, or use an old hard drive if you can find one.</p>

<h3>Back up data:</h3>
<p>Make sure you back up your data, including documents, graphics, music, and mail.  By default, most of this is stored in your Home directory (<strong>/home/YourUserName/</strong>).</p>
<br />

<h3>Back up configuration files:</h3>

<p>Here is a list of items for backup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>/home:&nbsp;</strong> Holds most of the personal configuration files.</li>
<li><strong>/root:&nbsp;</strong> Holds the changes you have made as root.</li>

<h3>Back up a list of installed program packages:</h3>
<p>It's also a good idea to save in your  /home/<em>username</em>
directory a file that contains the list of programs that you have installed with Synaptic, apt-get or KPackage (see <a href="index.html#section07-1"> Section 7:     Software Management </a>). If in the future you need to reinstall, you'll just have to paste the names of the files to an <strong>apt-get install</strong> command. You can create an inventory of all packages on your system installed since installation with:</p>

<pre>dpkg --get-selections &gt;list_packages.txt
</pre>

<p>To reinstall ALL those packages at once: </p>

<pre>dpkg --set-selections &lt;list_packages.txt
apt-get update
apt-get dselect-upgrade
</pre>

<h2 id="s08-08_keep">Back up using <em>Keep</em></h2>

<p><strong>Keep</strong> is a front end for <strong>Rdiff-Backup</strong> that functions as a backup system for KDE.  It is installed with MEPIS Linux 8.0 and can be found by clicking <strong>KMenu --&gt; System --&gt; Backup System (Keep)</strong>.</p>  <p>NOTE: You must run <strong>Keep</strong> as root to avoid getting an error message.  You can set this by right-clicking the Keep menu entry, selecting Edit Item, checking Run as different user, and entering <strong>root</strong> as the user's name.  Also, it is important to make sure that permissions are set identically on the directories being used.</p>

<p>To back up using <strong>Keep,</strong> follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Open the app, click on <strong>Add directory</strong> to backup.</li>
 <li>Select a directory for backup, e.g. the default <strong>/home/<em>username</em>.</strong></li>
 <li>Choose a backup location, e.g. /mnt/SomeRemoteLocation. You can also back up over a network, see the Keep FAQs. </li>
 <li>Decide on any backup options, e.g., how frequently the backup should occur. </li>
 <li>Click on <strong>Finish.</strong></li>
 <li>Click on Backup now, highlight the source to back up, and click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>To restore a back up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the app, click on <strong>Restore a backup.</strong> </li>
<li>Select the backup to restore.</li>
<li>Select the destination directory.</li>
<li>Choose a backup date to restore, if there is more than one date.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Finish.</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="s08-08_cloning">Disk cloning</h2>
<p>As a precaution in case of complete harddisk failure, some users create a complete image of their harddrive, a technique called <em>disk
cloning</em> or <em>ghosting.</em> In case a new harddrive must be installed, the user can simply restore the entire image to be back in
operation in a few minutes. Open-source (e.g., Partimage, G4L) and proprietary (e.g., Acronis) ghosting software are available to
carry out this procedure.  Depending on the software used, you may have to carry this out from a separate drive or a LiveCD. </p>

<p>Cloning can also be used to make an identical working copy of your hard disk or partition to a second disk or partition with an equal or larger size than the original by using the command line tool dd. Unlike the cloning tools listed above, dd copies the hard disk or partition on a sector by sector basis, so everything is copied, including unused sectors. That being the case, it can take some time for larger drives.</p>

<h2 id="s08-08_unneeded">Remove unneeded services</h2>
<p>It's a good idea to remove services that start at boot time and you don't need both to improve security and to limit resources
utilization.  To stop a program, for example called <strong>UnneededProgram</strong> from starting, execute this command as
root:</p>
<pre>
update-rc.d -f UnneededProgram remove
</pre>

<p>Here is a list of services that you might not need (check!):</p>
<ul>
<li>spamassassin:  e-mail spam filter.</li>
<li>hpoj: HP Office Jet printer driver.</li>
<li>cupsys:  Common UNIX Printing System(tm).</li>
<li>ntpdate:  Set system time from internet NTP servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also KDE applications for configuring other services.  Installed by default is  found by clicking <strong>KMenu --> Control Center --> KDE Components --> Service Manager</strong>.  The Service Manager module displays a static list of services that are started on demand and cannot be modified, and a second list of services that can be loaded when KDE starts or manually started when needed.  You can also install <strong>KSysV</strong> from the repos for more advanced control of the startup scripts.</p>

<h2 id="s08-08_disk-maintenance">Disk maintenance</h2>
<p>It is rare that you will need to do much disk maintenance compared to  Windows, since Linux operating systems and the disk filesystems they utilize are  designed differently. Still, there may come a moment when you want to check for partition/disk errors, something done in Windows with <strong>scandisk.</strong> To check for filesystem and disk read/write errors, go through the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --&gt; System --&gt; MEPIS --&gt; MEPIS System Assistant</strong>, and supply the root password.
</li>
<li>Click on the tab Repair Partition.
</li>
<li>When run from within the installed operating system, the Assistant will only test the drive.
</li>  
<li>If you want to actually repair problems, you need to run the System Assistant after booting from the LiveCD and choose <strong>bad
blocks.</strong> The Assistant will ask you interactively if you want to repair problems it uncovers.
</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: The act of defragmenting or &ldquo;defragging&rdquo; a drive, so well known in Windows&reg;, is ordinarily unneeded in MEPIS Linux 8.0 as long as you have a standard Linux <a class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_filesystem " title="see Glossary for &ldquo;filesystem&rdquo;">filesystem</a> such as <em>ext3</em> or <em>ReiserFS.</em></p>
<br />
<br />


<h2 id="s08-08_upgradeprecautions">Upgrade precautions</h2>
<p>These are some time-tested rules of thumb for new users of MEPIS Linux to avoid getting into trouble when upgrading their software:</p>

<ul>
<li>Always read the prompts carefully.
</li>
<li>Use the recommended URLs in your <strong>sources.list</strong> of software repositories.
</li>
<li>If upgrading in a terminal, use <strong>upgrade</strong>. Never use <strong>dist-upgrade</strong> or <strong>smart
upgrade</strong>.
</li>
<li>When given the choice between the maintainer's config file and what's on your system, take the time to consider the options.  If you have no other idea, then accept system changes coming from the MEPIS development source, but keep your current one for all others.
</li>
<li>Sometimes packages are held back because they need to install or upgrade additional packages to be upgraded.  Other times they are held back because they will uninstall large portions of your system if you install them.  If you can't figure out the reason, it is better to leave them alone.
</li>
</ul>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 08.11  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section08-11">8.11:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; antiX </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- revised by SilverBear for the MEPIS 8 manual-->
<p>This document is taken from the official anti FAQ (<a href="index.html#s08-11_links">see links</a>) and is intended for the first-time user. When you boot up antiX you are probably looking at a desktop that differs in look and function from the familiar. This difference is due to the <a class="spterm" title="click to see glossary entry" href="index.html#s12-1_window-man">window managers</a> being used to control what the end-user can see and do. We hope these FAQs will give you a basic orientation to antiX and its window managers, and provide the means to explore further on your own.</p>
<p>Be advised that unlike the rest of the MEPIS User's Manual, this antiX section contains external links embedded in the text. It might be wise to right-click and choose <em>open in a new tab</em> when exploring them.</p>

<h3>Window Managers</h3>

<h4>What window managers are available in antiX? </h4>
<p>Two different window managers come installed and ready to use:<br />

1) the minimalist manager Fluxbox (default)<br />

2) the lightweight IceWM.</p>

<p>Both window managers can be run with or without the ROX Desktop environment that provides drag-and-drop functionality and the Conky system monitor that displays real-time information.</p>

<h4>How do I change from one to another? </h4>
<p>You can easily switch from the default Fluxbox by right-clicking anywhere on the desktop to display the menu (from now on = &#8220;Menu&#8221;),
then clicking WM's to select one of the others.</p>

<h4>And to get back? </h4>

<p>ROX pinboard or panel: click Menu --&gt; WM's --&gt; ROX and select the appropriate toggle. </p>
<p>Conky: in Fluxbox, click Menu --&gt; WM's --&gt; Conky on/off.</p>
<p>IceWM: click Start --&gt; Programs --&gt; Desktop --&gt; Alternatives --&gt;FluxBox.</p>

<h4>How do I get out of antiX? </h4>

<p>Click Menu --&gt; Exit, which will present you with the choice to lock screen, log out, reboot, or shut down. </p>

<h3 id="First_look-1"><u>Fluxbox: First look</u></h3>

<h4>Where do I start? I don't see a Start or Menu button.</h4> 

<p>Just right-click anywhere on the desktop and use the menu to open any application.</p>

<h4>What is this desktop? </h4>

<p>The desktop is run by <a href="http://fluxbox.sourceforge.net/">Fluxbox,</a> a lightweight window manager for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">the X Window System</a> that provides the display resources and functions.</p>

<h4>Where are the icons? </h4>

<p>Fluxbox does not use icons, but you can switch to the ROX desktop (<a href="#rox">see section below</a>) if you would like them.</p>

<h4>What's that stuff in the upper left corner?</h4> 

<p>That is the output of <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky,</a> a light-weight system monitor that gives you real-time information on various aspects of your computer.</p>

<h4>And that bar at the bottom? </h4>

<p>That is called the <em>toolbar</em> or <em>panel,</em> and it displays current info such as the workspace, open applications, background applications and the date/time.</p>

<br />

<h3 id="Basic_configuration-1"><u>Basic Configuration</u></h3>

<h4>How do I set up a wireless connection? </h4>

<p>There are 3 options, all found in the antiX Contol Centre (CC): Wicd, MEPIS Network Assistant and ceniwrapper. </p>

<p>1) In the directory Menu --&gt; Settings --&gt; Control Centre --&gt; Network --&gt; you will find the wireless frontend <a href="http://wicd.sourceforge.net/">Wicd</a> that antiX uses to make its wireless connection. Hints on its use can be found <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Wicd">here.</a> See also the detailed <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Wireless_connection"> discussion in the MEPIS Wiki</a> for more information, and search the <a href="http://mepislovers.org/forums/index.php">MepisLovers forum</a> for particular cards.</p>

<p>2) For more advanced operations,l you can also consider the MEPIS

Network Tool, which can be found in the antiX CC.</p>

<p>3) The command-line (CLI) tool <a href="http://manual.sidux.com/en/internet-connecting-en.htm">Ceni</a> from the <a href="http://sidux.com/">Sidux</a>
developers is a wrapper that is very efficient for setting up a connection: select "Set Wired Connection."</p>

<h4>What about dial-up?</h4>
<p>In antiX CC --&gt; Network. This brings up <a href="http://www.gnomefiles.org/app.php?soft_id=41"> Gnome PPP,</a> a graphical frontend for the excellent <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/wvdial/"> WvDial</a> tool. Intuitive interface makes it easy to use. </p>

<h4>How do I set up printing? </h4>
<p>Unless you have an HP printer (see next entry), do one of the following:</p>
<p>1) In antiX CC --&gt; Hardware. A screen will open showing you the printers that have been found, with an icon to click for an assistant to add a new printer.</p>
<p>2) Open up a browser (Menu --&gt; Browser), and enter:</p>
<pre><a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/ </a></pre>
<p>This will take you to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Unix_Printing_System">CUPS</a> interface, where you can set up your printer. For help on particular printers and drivers, check the <a href="http://www.openprinting.org/printer_list.cgi"> OpenPrinting database.</a></p>

<h4>How do I set up an HP printer? </h4>
<p>You will need to install (see <a href="#install-1">installing software</a>) some additional packages:</p>
<pre>
hpijs
hpijs-ppd
hplip-data
hplip
hplip-gui
cups-pdf
cupsys-client
cupsys-driver-gutenprint
gs-gpl
lpr
magicfilter
gv
xprint-utils
</pre>
<p>You should then be able to set up your printer by opening up a browser (Menu --&gt; Browser), and entering:</p>
<pre><a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/ </a></pre>

<h4>What about a scanner? </h4>
<p>This one should be easy. Connect your scanner to the computer, and click Menu --&gt; Images --&gt; Scan (xsane) or Menu --&gt; Images
--&gt; Scanimage. This will bring up <a href="http://www.sane-project.org/man/xscanimage.1.html"> Xscanimage</a> where, after selecting from the scanners it has found (it may have multiple entries for your one scanner, so try them all until one works), you will see a very basic screen which is pretty self-evident.
 To adjust the values of your scanner, click Menu --&gt; Run and type <strong>xcam.</strong></p>

<p>You can then edit the scan in <a href="http://gqview.sourceforge.net/">GQview</a> (Menu --&gt; Images --&gt; Image browser). For details on using GQview, check <a href="http://gqview.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html">its User Manual.</a></p>

<h4> What application should I use for system setup?</h4> 
<p>antiX comes with <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/MEPIS_System_Assistant">the MEPIS Assistants</a> to make configuration of hardware easier. All can be found in the antiX CC --&gt; System </p>
<p>Details on this utility can be found in <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/MEPIS_System_Assistant">the MEPIS Wiki.</a></p>

<h4>I want to configure my monitor--how do I do that? </h4>
<p>The easiest method is to use the MEPIS X-Windows Assistant in antiX CC --&gt; System</p>
<p>For details on this application, see <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/MEPIS_X-Windows_Assistant">the MEPIS Wiki.</a></p>

<h4>Are there any other MEPIS Assistants I should know about? </h4>

<p>In addition to the MEPIS Network Assistant that has already been mentioned, the MEPIS User Assistant unites a number of tools having to do with user management. Found in antiX CC --&gt; System </p>
<p>For details on this application, see <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/MEPIS_User_Assistant">the MEPIS Wiki.</a></p>

<h4>Can I use a MP3 player such as an iPod with antiX? </h4>

<p>You can <a href="#music-1">play MP3 files with XMMS,</a> and you can view and edit ID3 tags by installing the program <a href="http://easytag.sourceforge.net/">EasyTAG.</a> But there is no simple way to synchronize your player with your host computer without installing Amarok and the KDE files it depends on.</p>

<h4>Is there a way to interact with a digital camera? </h4>
<p>The easiest method is to just treat it as a storage device by using a USB card reader. Then when you connect it to the computer, it will be mounted and available as an entry in the directory /media. You can either click Menu --&gt; Files to examine and move or delete the contents, or click Menu --&gt; Images --&gt; Image browser to bring up <a href="http://gqview.sourceforge.net/">GQview</a> that features single click access to view images and move around the directory tree.</p>

<h4>How do I install nvidia/Ati driver for antiX? </h4>
<p>The best way to do this is via the smxi script. See: <a href="#smxi ">8.11.5: smxi</a></p>

<h4>Can I use a webcam? </h4>
<p>Many webcams will work with antiX, see the discussion in <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/Webcam_Overview">the Mepis Wiki.</a></p> 
<br />

<h3 id="Basic_operation-1"><u>Fluxbox: Basic Operation</u></h3>

<h4>Where are my files? </h4>
<p>As in all Linux versions, personal files are located in antiX by default in the /home directory of <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/File_system"> the Linux file system.</a></p>

<h4> What is this?</h4> 
<p>The desktop is run by <a href="http://www.icewm.org/">IceWM,</a> a lightweight window manager for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System"> the X Window System</a> whose goal is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user's way.</p>

<h4>Where are the icons? </h4>
<p>IceWM does not use icons, but you can switch to the Rox desktop <a href="#rox%20">(see section below)</a> if you would like them.</p>

<h4>What's that stuff in the upper left corner?</h4> 
<p>That is the output of <a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky,</a> a light-weight system monitor that gives you real-time information on various aspects of your computer.</p>

<h4>And that bar at the bottom?</h4> 
<p>That is called the <em>toolbar</em> or <em>panel,</em> and it displays (L --&gt; R) the start button, a terminal button, a browser icon, the different workspaces, the taskbar, the CPU monitor, an email icon, and the date/time. </p>

<h3 id="Basic_customization-2"><u>IceWM: Basic Customization</u></h3>

<h4>How do you customize IceWM? </h4>
<p>It is done by directly editing the configuration files to create your own preferences. Files are found in antiX CC --&gt; Desktop --&gt; Edit IceWM Settings.</p>

<h4>What can I change?</h4> 
<p>You can change anything you want, following the guidelines in <a href="http://www.icewm.org/manual/icewm.html">IceWm Manual.</a></p>

<h4>What are the most common changes people make to the panel? </h4>
<p>Let's focus on four common changes to what you see and how it functions. Open ROX-Filer as described earlier, click on the eyeball to see hidden files, click on .icewm, and finally on Preferences to open that file in a text editor. When you are done with your changes, save and exit. They will take effect the next time you log into IceWM.</p>

<p>1) Change to a 12-hr clock: click on Search on the menu bar, and enter:</p>
<pre>timeformat</pre>
<p>Look for the entry that reads &ldquo;Clock Time format&rdquo; and change the entry below that so it reads:</p>
<pre>TimeFormat="%I:%M"</pre>
<p>Note that the line has been uncommented and the text in quotes has been changed.</p>
<p>2) Change the number of workspaces: click on Search on the menu bar, and enter:</p>
<pre>workspacenames</pre>
<p>Change the entry as you would like; for instance, it could read:</p>
<pre>WorkspaceNames=" 1 ", " 2 "</pre>
<p>3) Get the mailbox icon to work: click on Search on the menu bar, and enter:</p>
<pre>command to run on mailbox</pre>
<p>Change the entry below to read:</p>
<pre>MailCommand="claws-mail"</pre>
<p>Again, note that the line has been uncommented and the text in quotes has been changed.</p>
<p>4) Make the panel autohide: click on Search on the menu bar, and enter:</p>
<pre>autohide</pre>
<p>Change the line below it to read</p>
<pre>TaskBarAutoHide=1 # 0/1</pre>
<p>Note line has been uncommented and the value changed to &#8220;1&#8221; (true).</p>

<h4>How do I change the menu and the toolbar?</h4> 
<p>You can do it the same way you did with Preferences, or you can install the application icemc.</p>

<h4>How do I change the desktop wallpaper? </h4>
<p> Via antiX CC --&gt; Desktop --&gt; Choose Wallpaper. Note you can set a different wallpaper for each wm!</p>

<h4>How do I turn off Conky?</h4> 
<p> Click Start --&gt; Programs --&gt; Desktop --&gt;Conky on/off. </p>

<h3 id="First_look-3"><u>ROX: First look</u></h3>

<h4>What is this desktop? </h4>
<p>This is the <a href="http://roscidus.com/desktop/">ROX Desktop,</a> based around <a href="http://www.mepis.org/docs/en/index.php/File_system"> the Linux file system.</a> Its core component is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROX-Filer"> ROX-Filer,</a> a powerful graphical file manager that antiX uses as the default application for managing files. Other components available in antiX include the ROX-Panel and the ROX-Pinboard, toggled separately from
Fluxbox under the submenu Menu --&gt; WM's --&gt; ROX.</p>

<h4>What can you do with the ROX-Filer? </h4>
<p>Well, manage files of course! But it has many other capabilities that are covered below and in documents listed under <a href="#Links-3">Links.</a></p>

<h4>What is the ROX-Desktop good for?</h4> 
<p>Its great benefit is to allow you to use icons for any item in the file system with a simple drag-and-drop.</p>

<h4>What use is the ROX-Panel? </h4>
<p>Its primary function is to allow you to create and customize your own panel.</p> 
<br />

<h3 id="Basic_configuration-3"><u>ROX: Basic Configuration</u></h3>

<h4>How can I keep from having to toggle the ROX-Desktop every time? </h4>
<p>ROX-desktop can be made permanent through a simple edit in Fluxbox or IceWM. In antiX CC --&gt; Desktop --&gt; Edit Fluxbox Settings --&gt; Startup to open geany. Remove the ### from this line (in fluxbox, or add the line to IceWM startup file) </p>
<pre>### rox -pinboard=antiX &amp; </pre>
<p>Save and logout/login to your customized ROX-desktop (see below) using the window manager of your choice. Restore the comment symbols to this line if you want to stop the permanent use of the ROX-desktop.</p>
<p>Note: If you choose to have Rox-desktop permanent, then the pinboard/panel choices in the Fluxbox --&gt; WM's --&gt; Rox submenu should no longer be used. </p>
<br />

<h3 id="Basic_operation-3"><u>ROX: Basic Operation</u></h3>

<h4>What are the basic moves to use with ROX-Filer? </h4>
<ul>
<li>Left-click on the file/folder to open its contents.</li>
<li>A middle-click on a folder opens it in a separate file-manager window.</li>
<li>A middle-click on a file will open the file and close the file-manager window.</li>
<li>Right-click on a file/folder will open the ROX dialog box, where you can view and set options.</li>
</ul>

<h4>How do I move files around?</h4> 
<p>This is probably best done by having 2 file-manager windows open, and just drag from the one to the other.</p>

<h4>How do I put icons on my ROX desktop?</h4> 
<p>It's pretty easy! To add icons linking to devices, applications, folders and files to the desktop simply drag and drop from within ROX-Filer.</p>

<h4>What about a device, e.g. a cdrom or floppy drive? </h4>
<p>Open ROX-Filer and navigate to and open the /media folder. Left-click on the device you want, and drag and drop to wherever you want on the screen.</p>

<h4>Can I link applications?</h4> 
<p>You can do that too, though you first need to know where the bin for the app is. Usually it is usr/bin, but you can find it by opening a terminal and typing:</p>
<pre>which <em>NameOfApplication</em></pre>
<p>Once you know where it is, open ROX-Filer and navigate to its location. Left-click on the application file (if there is a symlink one, choose this) and--here we go again--drag and drop to where you want on the screen.</p>

<h4>Even folders and files are done the same way? </h4>
<p>You got it.</p>

<h4>What are the tricks with ROX-Panel? </h4>
<p>You use the same techniques as described above, just end up on the panel instead of the desktop. To remove again, right-click and select <em>Delete item</em>.</p>

<h4>I can still see my Fluxbox panel even though I toggled to the ROX-Panel. What should I do? </h4>
<p>It will disappear once your cursor is on the ROX-Panel, but there is an easy workaround: right-click the Fluxbox panel, and click on <em>Auto hide</em> to have it disappear when not in use.</p> 
<br />

<h3 id="Basic_customization-3"><u>ROX: Basic Customization</u></h3>

<h4>How do I change the Rox wallpaper?</h4> 
<p>Follow these steps:<br />

1) Put your wallpaper in the Wallpaper folder in your home directory.<br />

2) Click on the home folder, navigate to Wallpaper, and drag and drop (left mouse) your chosen background to the desktop.<br />

3) Right-click on the dragged file and choose Backdrop, then drag the

file into the space where it says Drop an image here. Select the image

treatment at the top (tile, stretch, etc.).<br />

4) Right-click on the dragged image file, and select Remove Item(s). </p>

<p>More information can be found in <a href="http://roscidus.com/desktop/node/72"> the desktop customization guide.</a> </p>
<br />

<h3 id="Advanced-3"><u>ROX: Advanced</u></h3>

<h4>How can I set the default opening application for a file?</h4> 
<p>If you wish to change the default application that will be used to open a file types, follow these directions.<br />

1) Right-click on the file you are interested in changing, and click File --&gt; Set Run Action<br />

2)Type the name of the application in the box labeled <em>Enter a shell command</em>. Note: Leave a space between the last letter of the app and the " sign.<br />

3) Save and now your file will open in the application of your choosing.</p>

<h4>Is it possible to have more than one pinboard configuration?</h4> 
<p>Yes it is. Open the default and make whatever changes you would like. Then open ROX-Filer, click the eye icon to see hidden files, and navigate to ~/.config/rox.sourgeforce.net/ROX-filer/. Right-click the file Pinboard to open as text, then save it with another name.</p>

<h4>Can I get ROX-Pinboard to open my own pinboard instead of the default one? </h4>
<p>You can launch your personal pinboard by editing the Fluxbox menu as described earlier. Open the Menu editor, and add this line anywhere:</p>
<pre>[exec] (Mypinboard) {rox --pinboard=mypinboard}</pre>
<p>Be sure to replace &#8220;mypinboard&#8221; wtih the actual name of the pinboard you want to load. This is great if you use pinboard only occasionally
and don't want to boot directly into it at startup. At the same time, it's faster than launching the command from terminal. In this fashion,
multiple pinboards can be configured, named (mypinboard2, etc.), and entered into the fluxbox menu. Very convenient!</p>

<h4>Can I customize the icons? </h4>
<p>If you have <a href="http://antix.mepis.org/index.php/Rox_tips_and_tricks_Adding_Icons_to_Desktop">added icons to the desktop,</a> then:<br />

1) Open ROX-Filer and navigate to the /.icons/ROX-SVG/scalable<br />

2) Open the folder that corresponds to the type you wish to alter.<br />

3) Right-click on the desktop icon type you want to alter (File or

Mount Point or Dir) and click Set Icon --&gt; Only for the file...<br />

4) Now drag and drop the icon from the ROX folder into the box and voila! The chosen icon now appears on the desktop.</p>

<h4>How do I edit the name of a file?</h4> 

<p>Right-click on the file's icon and click Edit Item and change the name displayed below The text displayed under the icon is... Then click OK.</p>

<h4>What are ROX hotkeys? </h4>
<p>Hotkeys in ROX allow a specific key sequence to open a folder or files with a single or at most 2 clicks. See <a href="http://antix.mepis.org/index.php/Rox_tips_and_tricks_Keyboard_Shortcuts"> this detailed explanation.</a> </p>

<h4 id="What_is_smxi">What is smxi?</h4>
<p><a href="http://techpatterns.com/forums/about736.html">smxi</a> is a script written by a programmer named h2 that enables users to keep their antiX install up-to-date and running as a rolling release.</p>

<h4 id="What_can_smxi_do">What can smxi do?</h4>
<p>When run, smxi allows users to install a new kernel, install ATI and Nvidia graphics drivers, run apt-get upgrade or apt-get dist-upgrade safely, change antiX to a Sid-based or sidux-based system, and lots more!</p>

<h4  id="How_to_use_smxi">How do you use smxi?</h4>
<p>smxi is already installed in antiX-M7.5 and ready to run. You <strong>MUST</strong> run smxi outside of <a  class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_x11" title="Glossary link to X-Window definition"  >X (the window system)</a> To get out of X when on your desktop, press Ctrl-Alt-F1 to get to a terminal prompt, then become root (su + password) and type:</p>
<pre> smxi</pre>
<p>smxi will ask a series of questions the first time it is run, including which system options you want to run (ie default, sidux, sid).  antiX developer anticapitalista suggests selecting the <strong>continue-no-changes</strong> option, using apt-get (rather than aptitude) and <strong>apt-get dist-upgrade</strong></p>

<h4  id="How_to_use_sgfxi">What about sgfxi?  What does that do?</h4>
<p>sgfxi is the script in smxi that deals with installing graphical drivers,  As with smxi, it <strong>MUST</strong> be run out of X desktop. At root login type </p>

<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section09-4">9.4:&nbsp; Virtual machines</a></em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There is a certain number of applications, both open-source and commercial, that will allow Windows applications to run under MEPIS Linux.  They are referred to as emulators, meaning that they duplicate the functions of Windows on a Linux platform.  Many MS Office applications, games and other programs can be run using an emulator with varying degrees of success ranging from near-native speed and functionality to only basic performance.</p>

<h2 id="s09-3_open">Open-source</h2>

<p><strong>Wine</strong> is the primary open-source Windows emulator for MEPIS Linux 8.0.  It is a kind of compatibility layer for running  Windows programs, but does not require Microsoft Windows&#174; to run the applications.  New Wine versions are rapidly packaged by Community members and made available on the MepisLovers Package Sharing forum and then on the Community website.</p>

<h1 id="section09-4">9.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual machines</h1>

<p><em>See also <a href="index.html#section09-3">9.3 Emulators</a></em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Virtual machine applications are a class of programs that simulate a "virtual computer" in memory, allowing you to install any operating
system on the machine.  It is useful for testing, running non-native applications, and providing users the feeling of having a machine of
their own.  Many MEPIS Linux users make use of virtual machine software to run Microsoft Windows &ldquo;in a window&rdquo; to seamlessly
provide access to software written for Windows on their desktop.  It is also used for testing to avoid installation.</p>

<h2 id="s09-4_apps">Applications</h2>
<p>A number of virtual machine software applications for Linux exist, both open-source and proprietary.  MEPIS 8.0 makes it particularly easy to use VirtualBox, so we will focus on that here.  For details and the most recent developments, see the MEPIS Wiki and MepisLovers Virtual Machines/Emulators forum linked below.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the basic steps to set up and run VirtualBox:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Prepare the machine</strong> -- You will need some packages before you can install and run VirtualBox.  Open a terminal, become root, and type or paste in these commands one at a time:
<pre>apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
ln -sf /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r) /usr/src/linux
apt-get install build-essential</pre>
</li>

<li><strong>Install VirtualBox</strong> -- This is most easily done with the MEPIS package from the repos, but it is also possible to download from the VirtualBox website.  Be sure to reboot after installation.
</li>

<li><strong>Create a Virtual Machine</strong> -- To create a virtual machine start VirtualBox, then click the <strong>New</strong> icon on the toolbar. You will need a Windows CD or a Linux ISO.  Follow the wizard, accepting all suggested settings unless you know better--you can always change them later.  Once the machine is set up, then click on <strong>Settings --> CD/DVD Rom</strong>, and check the Mount box to point to the CD or the ISO.
</li>

<li><strong>Install Guest Additions</strong> -- Be sure to install VirtualBox GuestAdditions to your Guest OS by booting into the Guest OS, then clicking <strong>Devices --> Install Guest Additions</strong> and pointing toward the <strong>VBoxGuestAdditions.iso</strong> that it will automatically locate.   This will allow you to enable sharing files between Guest and Host and to adjust your display in various ways so that it suits your environment and habits.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Excellent documentation is available through <em>Help</em> on the menu bar or as a PDF from the website.</p>

<h1 id="section09-5">9.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternate Window Managers </h1>

<h2>Traditional window managers</h2>

<p>A <a class="spterm" title="click to see glossary entry" href="index.html#s12-1_window-man">window manager</a> in Linux is essentially the component which controls the appearance of windows and provides the means by which the user can interact with them.  MEPIS Linux 8.0 comes with the K Desktop Environment, or <strong>KDE</strong> for short, which provides basic desktop functions, many applications for daily needs (Kmail, Amarok, K3b, etc.), and development tools and user documentation as well.   MEPIS Linux 8.0 uses KDE 3.5.10 because it is mature and stable; at some point in the future it will move to KDE 4.x, which is currently under intense development.</p>

<p>KDE is a very powerful desktop environment, but others are available from the repos. Once installed, you can choose the window manager you want from the <strong>Menu --> Session Type</strong> on the login screen (<strong>KDM</strong>) and log in to as you normally would.  For Gnome, you can replace KDM with the Gnome login screen <strong>GDM</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="s09-5_compiz">Compiz: the 3D window manager</h2>

<p>It is now possible to have great eye-candy from 3D-accelerated effects on the desktop, such as wobbly windows, window-drawing effects, or the now famous &ldquo;desktop cube.&rdquo;  MEPIS 8.0 makes it easy to use Compiz to do this, which makes use of new drivers Xgl and AIGLX and can create a cube workspace.  In addition, Compiz Fusion is a separate project that builds upon Compiz.</p> 
<p>Compiz packages are in the repos, along with additional plugins developed by Compiz Fusion (see also the method in the MEPIS Wiki).  The setup is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic and search on &ldquo;compiz&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>Check and install all packages found.
</li>
<li>Reboot the computer.
</li>
<li>Click on the new Compiz Fusion icon in the panel to start it.
</li>
<li>Right-click the icon to reload the window manager or configure Compiz.
</li>
<li>If you want Compiz to start on boot, create a link to <strong>/usr/bin/compiz</strong> in /home/UserName/.kde/Autostart
</li>
</ol>

<p>You will need good hardware and up-to-date video drivers for success.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 09.6  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section09-6">9.6:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accessing other partitions </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Immediately after installing MEPIS Linux you have access to the <a href="index.html#s12-1_rootfs" class="spterm" title="Basic logical structure of all the files the operating system can access." >root filesystem</a>.  Everything you need to run MEPIS Linux is already mounted there. But you may need to take extra steps to access data elsewhere, or you might want to set up a partitioning schema that safely stores your data outside your /home directory partition. In cases like that, you may need to know how to mount partitions other than your root partition.</p>

<p><span class="bcolor">But what exactly is a partition?</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Here is a good, basic definition from the Linux Documentation Project:</p>

<p class="quote"> <em>Partitioning is a means to divide a single hard drive into many logical drives. A partition is a contiguous set of blocks on a drive that are treated as an independent disk. A partition table is an index that relates sections of the hard drive and attached devices to partitions.</em></p>

<p>When you installed MEPIS Linux, it set up a root filesystem on the partition that you designated. But other partitions can be mounted to the root filesystem and so be made available to the system and its users.  </p>

<p>In general, a partition can be mounted dynamically whenever it becomes physically connected, mounted manually when you need access to it, or mounted automatically upon boot.  In terms of actual process, dynamic mounting is done by the by <strong>udev</strong> device manager, while the options for manual mounting as well as for automatic mounting at boot are governed by the configuration file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong>.  The <strong>udev</strong> device manager listens for devices being added or removed from the system, such as a USB drive, and makes them available to the system.  Usually, fstab is the only one that users might need to modify.</p>

<p>The following sections discuss these methods in more detail.</p>

<!-- ********************** Dynamic mounting with udev   **********************  -->

<h1 id="section09-6-1">9.6.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dynamic mounting</h1>
<p>Dynamic mounting occurs when a device is plugged into the system.  Most of the time, it will allow you to have access to the device's partition without any action on your part, usually through a window opened up by KDE.  Thus, when you plug in a device (USB memory stick, camera, PDA, etc.), the window that pops up showing the contents of that device ultimate depends on dynamic mounting by <strong>udev</strong>.</p>
<p>The following description udev outlines the mounting process (edited from Wikipedia):</p>
<p class="quote"> <em>udev is a generic kernel device manager that runs as a daemon [background process] on a Linux system and listens for a new device being initialized (or a device being removed) in the system. The system provides a set of rules that match the properties of the discovered device. A matching rule will possibly name and create a device node and run configured programs to set-up and configure the device.  udev rules can match on properties like the kernel subsystem, the kernel device name, the physical location of the device, or properties like the device's serial number. Rules can also request information from external programs to name a device or specify a custom name that will always be the same, regardless of the order devices are discovered by the system.</em></p>

<p>Rarely, however, no matching occurs and the device is not made available to the system by KDE.  This may be due to a hardware problem or a udev problem.  It is easy to find out whether the device has been recognized by the system. First plug it in, then open a terminal and type:</p>
<pre>dmesg | tail</pre>
<p>If the hardware has been recognized, you should see its name and address in the output.  That means that the problem lies at the next step, and you may have to modify udev (not recommended for newbies). Search first on your device ID number (e.g., ID 03f0:2112) to see what others have done.  For guidance on writing udev rules, consult the how-to below.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<br /><br />

<!-- ********************** Manual mounting   **********************  -->

<h1 id="section09-6-2">9.6.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Manual mounting</h1>

<p>If you need access only on an occasional basis to a partition that is not on a device dynamically mounted, such as a partition on your HDD from another OS, you can mount it manually with a couple of graphical tools in MEPIS Linux 8.0.</p>
<h2>My Computer</h2>
<p>A new feature of MEPIS Linux 8.0 is the presence on the desktop of an icon labelled <strong>My Computer</strong>.  When you click it, you will see a number of icons, one of which is called <strong>Storage Media</strong>.  Click on that, and you will see icons for all mounted storage media &mdash;simply click on the one that interests you to view the contents.</p>

<h2 id="s09-6-2_kwikdisk">KwikDisk</h2>
<p>KwikDisk is a kicker applet that will show up in the system tray (looks like three colored cubes) just to the right of the taskbar when set up by the user.  It is installed with MEPIS 8.0, so you can enable it by clicking <strong>KMenu --> System --> File System --> Removal Media Utility (KwikDisk)</strong>.  To have it be there permanently, create a link to it in <strong>/home/UserName/.kde/Autostart</strong>.</p>

<p>It has a variety of uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
It displays the available file devices (hard drive partitions, floppy and CD drives, etc.) along with information on their free space, type and mount point.
</li>
<li>
It allows you to easily mount and unmount drives. Just click on the partition you want to mount (e.g. sda1, sdb1, sdb2, etc.).
</li>
<li>
It is an entry for KDiskFree, a utility that measures available space.
</li> 
</ul>

<p>Again, simply click on the device that interests you to view the contents.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on KwikDisk, type <strong>man:kwikdisk</strong> into Konqueror's address bar.
</li>
<li>
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;on KDiskFree, type <strong>man:kdf</strong> into Konqueror's address bar.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This will work for any Linux partition, and for Windows 98, 2000 and XP as well.  You may have to provide root's password, depending on how permissions are set up.</p>

<br /><br />



<!-- ********************** Automatic mounting with fstab    **********************  -->
<h1 id="section09-6-3">9.6.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Automatic mounting</h1>
<p>In order to set MEPIS to automatically mount another partition at boot time so that it will be accessible at all times, you will need to edit options in the <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> configuration file.  Before we get into the details, let's go over the basic structure of every line in that file:</p>
<h3>The fstab file</h3>
<p>The file /etc/fstab has two parts: permanently available devices and, starting after the comment line: &ldquo;Dynamic entries below.&rdquo;  These are partitions detected at the time you installed MEPIS Linux, but which are not integral to operating MEPIS. They may be manually mounted, per Section 9.6.2, above. When they are mounted, the settings listed in /etc/fstab will govern their placement and permissions in the root filesystem.</p>  
<p>But when you wish to change a partition from the &ldquo;occasionally mounted manually&rdquo; category to one that is automatically mounted all the time, a few changes need to be made to the /etc/fstab configuration file.</p>

<p>Here is a typical entry for the first primary partition of a main hard drive:</p>
<pre>/dev/sda1   /   ext3   defaults,noatime   1   1</pre>

<p>Each of the six elements of this entry contains information that must be presented in a specific order, as we can show with this table where the same entry is divided out into the standard categories:</p>
<table class="screen">
<tr>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Device</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Mount Point</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Filesystem</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>Options</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>dump</strong>]</th>
      <th class="medium">[<strong>fsck order</strong>]</th>
</tr>
<tr>
      <td class="nobord">/dev/sda1</td>
      <td class="nobord">/</td>
      <td class="nobord">ext3</td>
      <td class="nobord">defaults, noatime</td>
      <td class="nobord">1</td>
      <td class="nobord">1</td>
    </tr>
<tr>
        <td class="nobord">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>
      
<p>Now that the structure of the entries makes some sense, we can proceed to edit the file.</p>
<br /><br />


<h2 id="s09-6-3_automount">Automounting a partition to the root filesystem</h2>
<p>As with most Linux configuration files, editing this configuration file (see <a href="index.html#section10-3">Section 10.3</a>) can easily be done with a text editor, <em>after</em> you back up the original file.</p>

<ol>
<li>
Open the <em>Konsole</em> terminal window (Kmenu --> system --> Terminal Program [Konsole]) and type:<br />
<pre>
cp /etc/fstab ~/Backups/fstab.original
</pre>
This will copy the current /etc/fstab into your /home/username/Backups directory under the name &ldquo;fstab.original&rdquo; in case you need to restore it later. To restore it you would need to issue this command <em>as root:</em>
<pre>
cp /home/<em>username</em>/Backups/fstab.original  /etc/fstab
</pre>
Note that in the first command, you copied a system file to your personal directory using the tilde &mdash;a shorthand for &ldquo;user home directory.&rdquo; All cool.  But the command to restore a system file needs to be much more precise. In addition to issuing the command <em>as</em> the root user, you need to specify the user home directory more strictly &mdash;from the root point of view.
<br />&nbsp;
</li>

<li>To open up the current /etc/fstab in the text editor <em>kwrite</em>, with root privileges, type in konsole:
<pre>
kdesu kwrite /etc/fstab 
</pre>
</li>

<li>
Locate the line designating the partition you want to have mounted; the first column will refer to it as /dev/sd<em>xn</em> where <em>x</em> is a letter and <em>n</em> is a number. Highlight the entire line and cut it, then paste it into the upper part of the file. For example let's use /dev/sda3 as it originally appears:
<pre>
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
# Dynamic entries below
/dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 ext2 noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda2 /mnt/sda2 auto noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda3 /mnt/sda3 auto noauto,users,exec 0 0
</pre>
For the future, when you're sober, it might be good to document your change with a comment line so you know what is what. The following is an example of the new line in place, with a comment line added:

<pre>
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
# automatically mounted partitions
/dev/sda3   /mnt/sda3   auto   noauto,users,exec 0 0
# Dynamic entries below
/dev/sda1   /mnt/sda1   ext2   noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda2   /mnt/sda2   auto   noauto,users,exec 0 0
</pre>
</li>

<li>
<strong>VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> you must change the option in column 4 to <strong>auto!</strong> Do <em>not</em> alter anything in column 3, which <em>may or may not</em> already contain the word &ldquo;auto.&rdquo; Column 3 refers to filesystem type, not to mounting options. The lines should now look similar to this, with <em>only one word changed:</em>

<pre>
sysfs /sys sysfs defaults 0 0
# automatically mounted partitions
/dev/sda3   /mnt/sda3   auto   auto,users,exec 0 0
# Dynamic entries below
/dev/sda1   /mnt/sda1   ext2   noauto,users,exec 0 0
/dev/sda2   /mnt/sda2   auto   noauto,users,exec 0 0
</pre>
</li>
<li>
Check to see that the original line for the partition is missing from the bottom section of Dynamic entries, and exists only in the new, upper section. An error will result if the line designating any partition exists twice.
</li>

<li>
Save the file and exit Kwrite.  To put your changes into effect, open a terminal, become root, and type:<pre>mount -a</pre>  <p>Now fstab will be parsed and all filesystems that are set to mount at boot will be immediately mounted if they are not already.  You will find the partition mounted under <strong>/mnt</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<br /><br />



<h2 id="s09-6-3_subdirectory">Automounting a partition to a subdirectory</h2>
<p>To make it more convenient, you can mount it to another location.  Let's say you want your Windows XP partition to show up as a mounted directory under /home.  Here's how:</p>  

<ol>
<li>First, create the folder where you want it to be.  Open Konqueror, right-click an empty space and click <strong>Create New --> Folder...</strong> and enter <strong>XP</strong> as the name we're going to use.
</li>
<li>Open up the current /etc/fstab in the text editor kwrite, with root privileges, by typing in konsole:
<pre>
kdesu kwrite /etc/fstab 
</pre>
<p>As before, back up the file before you start working on it.</p>
</li>
<li>Locate the line in the dynamic section for the partition you want to mount in /home.  Here we will assume the original line looks like this, though yours may differ:
<pre>/dev/hda1 /mnt/hda1 /mnt/hda1 ntfs-3g defaults,noatime 0 0</pre>
</li>
<li>Cut it from the dynamic section and paste it above in the fixed section.  Then change the mount location to your new directory:
<pre>/dev/hda1 /home/UserName/XP/ ntfs-3g defaults,noatime 0 0</pre>
</li>
<li>As before, if you see the word <strong>noauto</strong> in your particular entry, you should change it to <strong>auto</strong>.
</li>
<li>Save and exit.  When you reboot, your hda1 partition's contents should show up in the &ldquo;XP&rdquo; subdirectory in your /home directory.
</li>
<li>After first boot, you may find that MEPIS has changed the ownership of the subdirectory mointpoint to &ldquo;root&rdquo;. For mounting an NTFS partition this may not be a problem, as the default NTFS mount options set the group ID to &ldquo;users&rdquo; and allow that group rw permissions. If it is an ext3 or other Linux partition, you will not have write permission. So change the ownership back with the following CLI command, using Konsole:
<pre>
su [and give root password when prompted]
chown -R silverbear:users /home/silverbear
</pre>
<strong>Note:</strong> Most users will want to change <em>silverbear</em> to their own username. Check to see that you have the correct user and group owner with:
<pre>ls -l</pre>
or by checking your home directory in Konqueror using the <em>Detailed List View</em> mode.  Once it's fixed, subsequent booting does not affect the ownership.
</li>
</ol>
<br /><br />



<h2 id="s09-6-3_trouble">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h4>Windows FAT partition</h4>

<p>ALthough Windows NTFS partitions (as used in Windows 2000 and later) usually present little problem, there is sometimes difficulty with the necessary system permissions to write or delete files on a Windows FAT partition (as in Windows 98). If this seems to be the case on your computer, you'll need to insert a step after Step 4 above:</p>
<h5>Inserted Step: setting permissions when mounting a VFAT partition</h5>
<p>Set the following additional mount options for a Windows FAT partition. Note that MEPIS should already have identified it as a vfat partition in the third column, so all your changes need only be in the fourth column (bolded below):</p>

<pre>/dev/sda5   /mnt/sda5   vfat   <strong>user,users,gid=disk,umask=0000,utf8=true</strong>   0 0
</pre>
<p>If you need to set something other than full read/write/execute permissions for everyone who logs into your MEPIS system, you will need to do more study before fine-tuning your mounting permissions. </p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 09.7  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section09-7">9.7:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Scripts </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A script is a simple text file that can be written directly from a keyboard, and consists of a logically sequenced series of operating system commands.  The commands are handled one at a time by a command interpreter which in turn requests services from the operating system.  The default command interpreter in MEPIS is <strong>Bash</strong>.  The commands must be understandable to Bash, and command lists have been established for programming use. A  shell script is the Linux counterpart of batch programs in the Windows world.</p>
<p>Scripts are used throughout the Linux OS and applications that run on it as an economical method of executing multiple commands in an easily created and modified manner.  During boot, for instance, many scripts are invoked to start up specific processes such as printing, networking, etc.  Scripts are also used for automated processes, system administration, application extensions, user controls, etc.  Finally, users of all kinds can employ scripts for their own purposes.</p>
<h2>A simple script</h2>
<p>Let's do a very simple (and famous) script to get the basic idea. </p> 

<ul>
<li>Open the text editor KWrite (<strong>KMenu --> Office --> Editors</strong>, and type:
<pre>#!/bin/bash
clear
echo "Good morning, world!"</pre>
All scripts open with a <strong>shebang</strong> as in the first line: it is a combination of a number sign, an exclamation point, and the path to the command interpreter--here, Bash is the interpreter and it is found in the standard location for user applications.
</li>
<li>Save that file in your home directory with the name <strong>SimpleScript.sh</strong>.
</li>
<li>Right-click the file name, select Properties, and check "Is executable" on the Permissions tab.
</li>
<li>Open a terminal and type:
<pre>sh /home/UserName/SimpleScript.sh</pre>
</li>
<li>The line "Good morning, world!" will appear on your screen.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This simple script doesn't do very much, but it does establish the principle that a simple text file can be used to send commands to control your system's behavior.</p>
<h2 id="s09-7_example">Example of a useful script</h2>
<p>Let's look at a useful script for the ordinary user that reduces all the moves involved in backing up multiple sets of files into a single keystroke.  The script below relies itself on a system script provided by the default installation of MEPIS Linux 8.0 called <strong>Rdiff-backup</strong> that copies one directory to another, keeping a record of the differences in a special subdirectory so you can still recover files lost some time ago.  (Incidentally, Rdiff-backup uses in turn on a script called <strong>Diff</strong>.)</p>

<p>In this example, a user named &ldquo;newbie&rdquo; wants to set up a script to back up documents, music, mail and pictures from the /home directory to an external drive.</p>

<pre>1 #!/bin/bash
2 #
3 # This Rdiff-Backup script backs up to a second hard drive
4 # It must be run as root in order to mount the second hard drive
5
6 # To restore files, issue the command: cp -a /mnt/sda1/username /home
7 # To restore, but not overwrite: cp -a -i --reply=no /mnt/sda1/username /home
8
9 <strong># Mount the external devices</strong>
10
11 mount /dev/sdb1
12 mount /dev/sdb2
13 mount /dev/sdb3
14
15 <strong># Execute the backup</strong>
16
17 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Documents /mnt/sdb2/Documents
18 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Music /mnt/sdb1/Music
19 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Mail /mnt/sdb2/Mail
20 rdiff-backup /home/newbie/Pictures /mnt/sdb3/Pictures
21 
22 <strong># Unmount the external devices</strong>
23
24 umount /dev/sdb1
25 umount /dev/sdb2
26 umount /dev/sdb3</pre>
<p>Now let's look at this script's components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lines 2-7: a number sign has been placed in front of these lines (called "commenting them out") to indicate to Bash that they are not part of the sequence of commands to be executed.  Their purpose here is to provide anyone who looks at this script with information about such things as the script's origin, creator, purpose, and license (metadata).
</li>
<li>Line 9: good scripts separate the commands into clearly labelled procedural sections, bolded here and in lines 15 and 22.
</li>
<li>Lines 11-13: the three devices to be used for the backup have to first be mounted so they are available to the system.
</li>
<li>Lines 17-20: here bash is told to use the system script rdiff-backup to compare the original directories (sources) with the backup directories (targets), copy over the differences it finds, and keep a record of the changes.
</li>
<li>Lines 24-26: once the backup work is done, the external drives are unmounted from the system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyone who wanted to use such a script would have to carry out a few execution steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Copy the whole script.
</li>
<li>Right-click the desktop and select <strong>Create New --> Text file...</strong>
</li>
<li>Give the file a name that makes sense (no spaces, though), and add the "sh" extension so you will recognize it is a script.  For this example, you might select <strong>Backup_DocsMusicMailPictures.sh</strong>
</li>
<li>Open the new text file and paste in the script.
</li>
<li>Change any names, locations, etc. to what they are on your particular system.  In the example above, you may well have different names and/or locations for the directories to be backed up, and different devices where they are supposed to go.
</li>
<li>Save that script in a place you can easily find it when you need it, let's say you make a new directory <strong>/home/scripts</strong> for it.
</li>
<li>Right-click the script, select Properties, click on the Permissions tab, and check the <strong>Is executable</strong> box and click OK.
</li>
<li>When you are ready to backup, open a terminal and type:
<pre>sh /home/scripts/Backup_DocsMusicMailPictures.sh</pre>
<p>Hint: use the tab key to autocomplete the file name after you type the first few letters.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="section10-0">10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Hood</h1>

<h2>10.0: Introduction</h2>

<p>Users coming from Microsoft Windows&#174; typically find a lot of unfamiliar concepts, and get frustrated trying to do things the way they are accustomed to doing them.  This section will give you a conceptual overview of some basic aspects of MEPIS Linux, and how they differ from other systems to help ease your transition.</p>

<p>MEPIS Linux ultimately inherits its fundamental design from Unix, an operating system that has been around in various forms since 1970 &mdash;much earlier than MS-Windows&reg;.   &nbsp;MEPIS Linux 8.0 is also mainly composed of <strong>free, open-source software (FOSS)</strong> (i.e. software that is distributed without restrictions on the use of its source code).  The Unix heritage plus the open-source nature of MEPIS have a strong impact on its design.</p>

<p>Unix provided the foundation for the development of Linux starting in 1991.  As is well known, Linus Torvalds united his developing kernel with the free software framework of the GNU Project, started by Richard Stallman in 1984, and the resulting OS is now referred to most correctly as GNU-Linux.</p>  

<p>A user interface of some sort  needs to serve for input and control.  At its simplest, this interface is a command line, as in the original Unix and also in the original MS-DOS prior to MS-Windows, but today all the most popular Linux versions today use a graphical user interface (GUI) that relies on the X Window System, a software system and protocol that provides the basic framework for graphical display.</p> 

<p>Finally, MEPIS builds directly on the highly popular Linux <a href="index.html#s12-1_distro" class="spterm" title="Software project that manages a remote collection of Linux-based software" >distribution</a> called Debian, its direct upstream source of fundamental structures and features.  Founded in 1993, Debian has become preeminent in areas such as package development, release protocol, organizational structure and commitment to free software.  To the solid core provided by Debian's stable release (which the Debian development version &ldquo;Lenny&rdquo; is about to become), MEPIS adds user-friendly  features such as a very simple installation tool, excellent hardware recognition, a set of configuration &ldquo;Assistants,&rdquo; and a LiveCD framework &mdash;all supported by a lively and knowledgeable Community that contributes to MEPIS the artwork and documentation, as well as additional software packages.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.1  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-1">10.1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The filesystem structure</h1>
<h2>Orientation</h2>

<p>There are two basic uses of the term &ldquo;filesystem.&rdquo; The first is the Operating System's Filesystem. This refers to the files and their organization that the operating system uses to keep track of all the hardware and software resources it has as its disposal while running. The other use of the term filesystem refers to the Disk Filesystem, designed for the storage and retrieval of files on a data storage device, most commonly a disk drive. The Disk Filesystem is set when the disk partition is first formatted, prior to writing any data on the partition.  </p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-1_os">The Operating System's Filesystem</h2>
<p>One of the first problems many new Linux users struggle with is how the filesystem works. If you have been looking around your MEPIS Linux 8.0 system trying to find the <strong>C:\</strong> drive or <strong>D:\</strong> drive, for instance, you are searching in vain: MEPIS handles hard drives and other storage media differently from Windows. Rather than having a separate filesystem tree on every device, MEPIS has a single filesystem tree ( called the <em>root</em> of the filesystem) which is marked &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo; and contains <em>every</em> attached device.  When a storage device is added to the system, its filesystem is attached to a directory or subdirectory of the file system; this is called <strong>mounting</strong> a drive or device. </p>


<p> If you open Konqueror and browse to &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo;, you will notice a number of directories with names based on the <strong>Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</strong>. Here is a simple description of the major directories in MEPIS 8.0 along with a common example of when users commonly work with files there (see MEPIS Wiki for details):</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>/bin</strong>  This directory contains binary program files which are used by the system during startup, but which also may be required by user actions once the system is fully up and running.
<p><em>Example</em>: Many basic command-line programs, such as the Bash shell, and utilities like <em>dd</em>, <em>grep</em>, <em>ls</em>, and <em>mount</em> are located here, in addition to programs only used by the OS. </p>
<hr /></li>



<li><strong>/boot</strong>  As you might guess, files that Linux needs to boot are located here. The Linux kernel, the core of the Linux operating system, is kept here, as are bootloaders such as GRUB.  
<p><em>Example</em>: users modify <strong>/boot/grub/menu.lst</strong> to change the list of bootable  operating systems or the length of time to wait for default booting.</p>
<hr /></li>



<li><strong>/dev</strong>  In this directory are special files that link to the various input/output devices on the system.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed directly by users, except in CLI mounting commands.</p>
<hr /></li>



<li><strong>/etc </strong> This directory contains configuration files for the system such as  as well as application configuration files.
<p><em>Example</em>: The file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> specifies mount points for additional filesystems on devices, partitions, etc. that can be configured for your optimal use.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: display problems sometimes involve editing the file <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong>.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/home</strong> Here the user's personal directories (data and settings) reside. If there is more than one user, a separate subdirectory is set up for each. No user (except root) can read another user's home directory.  The user's directory contains both hidden (where the filename is preceded by a dot) and visible files; hidden files can be revealed by clicking <strong>View --> Show Hidden Files</strong> in Konqueror.
<p><em>Example:</em> users typically organize their own files at first by using default directories such as Documents, Music, etc.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> your Firefox profile is located in <strong>.mozilla/firefox</strong></p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/lib</strong>  This directory contains shared object libraries (analogous to Windows DLL's) that are required at boot time. In
particular, kernel modules will be found here, under <strong>/lib/modules</strong>.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/media </strong> Files for removable media such as CDroms, floppy drives, and USB memory sticks are installed here when the media are automounted.
<p><em>Example</em>: After dynamically mounting a peripheral device like a flash drive, you may access it here.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/mnt</strong> Physical storage devices must be mounted here before they can be accessed. After drives or partitions are defined in the <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> file, then their filesystem is mounted here.
<p><em>Example</em>: Users can access drives and partitions mounted here.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/opt</strong> This is the intended location of major third-party application subsystems installed by the user. 
<p><em>Example</em>: if you want to install Google Earth, this is where you place it. Some distros, including MEPIS, also place user-installed programs in /usr subdirectories.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/root</strong> This is the <em>home directory</em> for the root (adminstrator) user. Note that this is not the same as &ldquo;<strong>/</strong>&rdquo; the filesystem root.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users, but files saved while logged in as the root user may be saved here.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/sbin</strong>  Programs are installed here if they are required by the system startup scripts but will not normally be run by
users, other than root  &mdash;in other words, system administration utilities. 
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users, but this is where files like modprobe and ifconfig are located.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/tmp</strong> This is the location of temporary files produced by programs  &mdash;such as compilers&mdash;  as they run. In general, these are short-term temporary files, of use to a program only while it is running.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users.</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/usr</strong> This directory contains many things for user applications, and is analogous in some ways to the Windows directory &ldquo;Program Files&rdquo;. 
<p><em>Example</em>: many executables are located in (<strong>/usr/bin</strong>)</p>
<p><em>Example</em>: documentation (<strong>/usr/docs</strong>) and configuration files, graphics and icons are in (<strong>/usr/share</strong>).</p>
<hr /></li>


<li><strong>/var</strong> This directory contains files that are constantly changing while Linux is running, e.g. logs, system mail and queued processes.
<p><em>Example</em>: no file here is commonly accessed by users.</p>
<hr /></li>

</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-1_disk_fs">The Disk Filesystem</h2>
<p>The disk filesystem is something about which the average user does not need to be much concerned. The default disk filesystem used by MEPIS Linux 8.0 is called <strong>ext3</strong>, a version of the ext2 filesystem that is journaled &mdash;i.e., it writes changes to a log before enacting them, rendering it more robust. The filesystem ext3 is set during installation when your your hard drive is formatted.</p> 
<p>By and large, ext3 has more years, in its track record over any of its rivals, of combining stability and speed, and we do not recommend installing MEPIS onto a different disk filesystem unless you are well-educated in the differences.  However, MEPIS can read and write to many other formatted disk filesystems, and may even be installed on some of them, if for some reason one of them is preferred over ext3. </p>

<p>NOTE: if you are dual or multi-booting different operating systems on the same computer, see <a href="index.html#section09-6">Section 9.6: Accessing other partitions</a> for more information.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.2  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-2">10.2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Permissions</h1>


<p>MEPIS is an account-based operating system. This means that no program can run without a user account to run under, and any running program is thereby limited by the permissions granted to the user who started it. </p>

<p>In MEPIS Linux 8.0 there is one and only one user account which has permission to do everything; this account is called <strong>root</strong> (not to be confused with the &ldquo;root&rdquo; of the filesystem, mentioned in Section 10.1 see: <a class="spterm" href="#s12-1_rootfs" title="see Glossary for more info.">root filesystem</a>). The <a class="spterm" href="#s12-1_rootuser" title="see Glossary for more info.">root user</a> has a unique password that is set during system installation. When you run programs (such as Synaptic or MEPIS System Assistants) that need to access or change protected operating system files and directories, you will be prompted for the root password.  Once you enter it, MEPIS will be able to make the specific changes it needs.</p>
<p></p>

<p>NOTE: Much of the security and stability that Linux is known for hinges on the proper use of limited user accounts, and the protection provided by default file and directory permissions. For this reason, you should operate as <em>root</em> only for a procedure that requires it. Never log into MEPIS as root to run the computer for normal activities! </p>

<br />
<h2 id="s10-2_basic">Basic information</h2>
<p>The default file permissions structure in Linux is fairly simple, but more than adequate for most situations.  For each file or folder, there are three permissions that can be granted, and three entities (owner/creator, group, others/world) to which they are granted.  The permissions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Read</strong> permission means that data can be read from the file; it also means the file can be copied. If you don't have read permission for a directory you can't even see the names of files listed in it.
</li>
<li><strong>Write</strong> permission means that the file or folder can be changed, appended, or deleted.  For directories, it specifies whether a user can write to files in the directory.
</li>
<li><strong>Execute</strong> permission means whether or not the user can run the file as a script or program.  For directories, it determines whether or not the user can enter and make it the current working directory. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Every file and folder acquires a single user designated as its owner when it is created on the system.  (Note that if you move a file from another partition where it has a different owner, it will keep the original owner; but if you copy and paste it, it will be assigned to you.)  It also has a single group designated as its group, by default the group to which the owner belongs.  The permissions you grant to others affect everyone who isn't the owner or in the owning group.</p>

<p>NOTE: For advanced users, there are additional special attributes beyond read/write/execute that can be set: sticky bit, SUID, and SGID.  For more information, see <a href="index.html#s10-2_links">Links and Guides for Section 10.2.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-2_view-set">Viewing, setting and changing permissions</h2>
<h3>Konqueror</h3>
<p>To view or change a file's permissions in KDE, right-click the file and select <strong>Properties</strong>.  Click the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab.  Here you can set the permissions granted to the owner, group, and others using the pull-down menus.  For some files (like <a href="index.html#section09-7">scripts</a>, for instance), you need to check the box to make them executable, and for folders you can check a box to limit the deletion of files inside it to the owners. If necessary, you can click <strong>Advanced Permissions</strong> and see the permissions grid for the file.</p>
<p>NOTE: you must be operating as root to change the permission of a file or directory whose owner is root.</p>
<br />
<h3 id="s10-2_kuser">KUser</h3>
<p>KUser is part of KDE and can be reached by clicking <strong>KMenu --> System --> More Applications --> User Manager (KUser)</strong> and supplying the root password.  The main screen has two tabs, one for users and the other for groups; above them sits a toolbar and on top a menu bar.  Here are the icons on the toolbar:</p>

<img src="grafx/KUser_icons.jpg" alt="KUser icons" width="226" height="31" />
<p>The first three buttons in the toolbar have to do with user management (default tab): add user, edit user, and delete any user highlighted. The second three are used with similar functions for group management (Groups tab), and allow you to decide who belongs to each group. The screens that pop up are pretty self-explanatory, but you can consult the KUser Handbook found under Help.</p>

<h3 id="s10-2_muser">MUser</h3>
<p>The <a href="index.html#section05-3-3">MEPIS User Assistant</a> can also be used to add or delete a user.  In addition, it can restore default values for groups and memberships.</p>

<br />
<h3 id="s10-2_cli">CLI commands</h3>

<p>Although Konqueror and KUser cover most daily situations, sometimes it can be preferable to deal with the command line.  Basic permissions are represented by <strong>r</strong> (read), <strong>w</strong> (write) and <strong>x</strong> (execute).</p> 

<p>To view permissions of a file on the command line, type this: </p> 
<pre>ls -l NameOfFile</pre>
<p>The -l switch will cause the file to be list in long format, displaying its permissions among other information.  Here is an example of what the user "newbie" might see for the Firefox profiles.ini file:</p> 
<pre>newbie@Computer:$ ls -l /home/newbie/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini
-<strong>rw-r--r--</strong> 1 newbie users 94 2008-10-22 10:07 profiles.ini
</pre>
<p>The bolded "rw-r--r--" bit right after the opening dash (indicating it is a regular file) contains read/write/execute permissions for owner, group and others: 9 characters total.  Here it shows us that the owner has read and write but not execute (<strong>rw-</strong>), but the group and others can only read (<strong>r--</strong>).  The owner in this case is specified to be "newbie" who belongs to the group "users".</p>

<p>If for some reason it was necessary to change the ownership of this file to root using the command line, you would use the <strong>chown</strong> command like this:</p>
<pre>chown root /home/newbie/.mozilla/firefox/profiles.ini</pre>
<p>For details on using chown, as well as the more detailed <strong>chmod</strong>, see <a href="index.html#s10-2_links">Links and Guides for Section 10.2.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Sometimes a program needs to have a user registered before it will operate correctly. Let's take an example with the photo organizer DigiKam, which can be fussy about this. According to the directions on the DigiKam home page, the username should be added to the user group &ldquo;camera&rdquo; but that group is not listed. Here's how you would do that: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>KMenu --> System --> More Applications --> User Manager (KUser)</strong>, and supply root's password.
</li>
<li>Click on the Groups tab, and confirm that there is no group name &ldquo;camera.&rdquo;
</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>add group</strong> icon, or on the menu bar Group --> Add... 
</li>
<li>In the dialogue box that pops up, type <strong>camera</strong> as Group name.
</li>
<li>Highlight your username in the column on the right, then click the middle <strong>Add...</strong> button to move your username into the column Users in Group. 
</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK.</strong>
</li>
<li>The Group tab now includes the group &ldquo;camera&rdquo; with your username. 
</li>
</ol>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.3  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-3">10.3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Configuration files</h1>


<p>With only rare exceptions, program and system settings on MEPIS Linux 8.0 are stored in discrete plaintext configuration files; there is no &ldquo;Registry&rdquo; which requires special tools to edit.  Most configuration files are just simple lists of parameters and values which are read by programs when they launch to determine their behavior.</p>

<h2>User config files</h2>
<p>Files that hold individual user settings (such as high scores for your games, or the layout of your desktop) are stored within a user's home directory, typically as a hidden file or directory, and can only be edited by that user or by root.</p>  
<p>These personal configuration files are actually less often edited directly than system files because most of the user configuration is done graphically through the applications themselves.  When you open an application and click <strong>Edit --> Preferences</strong>, for example, your selections are written to a (usually hidden) configuration file in your user directory.  Likewise in Firefox, when you type <strong>about:config</strong> in the address bar, you are editing the hidden configuration files.</p>
<br /><br />


<h2 id="s10-3_system">System config files</h2>
<p>Files that hold system-wide configurations or defaults (such as the file that determines which services automatically launch during boot up) are largely stored in the <strong>/etc/</strong> directory and are only editable by root.  Most of these files are never touched directly by regular users, such as these for instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/etc/rc.d/rc5.d</strong> &mdash; Contains files to control runlevel 5 into which MEPIS boots after login.
</li>
<li><strong>/etc/sysconfig/keyboard</strong> &mdash; Used to configure the keyboard.
</li>
<li><strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong> &mdash; Defines internet interfaces on the system.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some configuration files can contain just a few lines, or even be empty, while others may be quite long.  The important point is that if you are looking for a configuration file for an application or process, head for the <strong>/etc</strong> directory and look around.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-3_example">Example</h2>
<p>We already looked at editing the configuration file <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> to mount other partitions (<a href="index.html#section09-6">Section 9.6</a>), but let's look at another example here.</p>

<p>Display problems can be solved with a number of grahical and command-line tools, as we saw in <a href="index.html#section05-2-2">Section 5.2.2</a>, but once in a while a user needs to directly edit the system-wide configuration file <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong>.  (NOTE: like all configuration files, this should always be backed up before editing.)  This file is long and has lots of entries, but let's say you are still having problems with your USB mouse after using the standard tools, and want to check how it is actually configured.  You open the file, then search and find the correct entry, something like this:</p>

<pre>Section "InputDevice"
  Identifier "USB Mouse"
  Driver "mouse"
  Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
  Option "Protocol" "auto"
  Option "ZAxisMapping" "4 5"
  Option "Buttons" "5"
EndSection</pre>
<p>To try to improve mouse functionality, you might decide to substitute the exact information about the mouse's manufacturer and model in place of the word &ldquo;auto.&rdquo;  Similar steps are sometimes taken with a monitor or keyboard, for instance, when no other tool has worked.</p>

<!-- ########################### SECTION 10.4  ########################### -->
<h1 id="section10-4">10.4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Runlevels</h1>
<p>MEPIS Linux boots up by executing the program <strong>init</strong>. After completing the boot process, <strong>init</strong>
executes all start scripts in a directory specified by the default runlevel (this runlevel is given by the entry for id in
<strong>/etc/inittab</strong>). Like most other Linux versions, MEPIS has 7 runlevels:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Halt (power down)</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Single-user mode: provides a root console without logon.  Useful if you lose your root password</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Multiuser with no network</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Console logon, no X (i.e. no GUI)</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Not used/custom</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>Default GUI logon</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Reboot </td></tr>
</table>

<p>MEPIS defaults to runlevel 5, therefore any <strong>init</strong> scripts set up in the level 5 config file will run at boot.</p> 
<br /><br />
 
<h2 id="s10-4_use">Use</h2>
<p>Understanding runlevels can be handy.  When users have a problem with X Window Manager, for instance, they can not work on it on the default runlevel 5, because as we just saw that is the level where X runs.  But they can drop to runlevel 3 where they can work to fix things by opening a terminal, becoming root, and typing:</p>
<pre>
telinit 3
</pre>
<p class="fl">Once you are out of X and looking at a prompt, login with your normal username and password.  To get back to the login screen, become root and
type:</p>

<pre>
telinit 5
</pre>

<p>Other useful commands when you are looking at the prompt on runlevel 3 include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>halt</strong> (as root) &mdash;  shuts the machine down.</li>
<li><strong>reboot</strong> (as root) &mdash; reboots the machine.</li>
<li><strong>[application command]</strong>  &mdash; will run that application.</li>
</ul>

<p class="fl">It is equally possible to <em>boot</em> to runlevel 3 by merely adding the number three at the end of the boot options on the GRUB screen.  From there you can simply type: </p>
<pre>startx</pre> 
<p class="fl">to get to runlevel 5 and your desktop.</p>

<h1 id="section10-5">10.5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Kernel </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Last place in this User's Manual goes to the first and most important element of MEPIS Linux 8.0: the Linux kernel.  Every Linux version (distro) uses some version of the kernel, which was first developed and is still maintained by Linus Torvalds, with input from many other programmers around the world.</p>
<p>The following diagrams and descriptions of the GNU/Linux kernel come from the <em>Anatomy of the Linux kernel</em> and gives the average user a clear sense of the kernel's place in the Linux  OS:</p>
<img src="grafx/Kernel.jpg" alt="Kernel" width="370" height="250" />
<p><em>At the top is the user, or application, space. This is where the user applications are executed. Below the user space is the kernel space. Here, the Linux kernel exists.</em></p>

<p><em>There is also the GNU C Library (glibc). This provides the system call interface that connects to the kernel and provides the mechanism to transition between the user-space application and the kernel. This is important because the kernel and user application occupy different protected address spaces. And while each user-space process occupies its own virtual address space, the kernel occupies a single address space. </em></p>
<p>The kernel itself has a number of components that include process management, memory management, network stack (definition of a particular group of protocols along with the software to implement them), virtual file system, and device drivers. The largest of these by far is the collection of device drivers that are necessary to make your hardware usable.</p>

<p>Much more detail is available from the documents referenced in the <a href="index.html#s10-5_links ">Links and Guides for Section 10.5.</a></p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-5_versions">Kernel versions</h2>

<p>The Linux kernel is in constant development, so it uses a version numbering system to keep track.  MEPIS Linux 8.0 is released using the kernel <strong>2.6.27</strong>, but that will change over time.  To find out your current major kernel version name, open a terminal and type:</p>
<pre>$ uname -r</pre>
<p>You will see a result something like <strong>2.6.27-1-mepis-smp</strong> (32bit) or <strong>2.6.27-1-mepis64-smp</strong> (64bit).  The MEPIS kernel also has an internal version number that you can see by looking on the "Installed files" tab of the current kernel entry in Synaptic.</p>
<p>Unlike other software on your system, the kernel is not upgraded automatically except below the minor revision level (indicated by the third number in the kernel name).  To upgrade the kernel when a new one becomes available in the repos, follow this procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Synaptic as root and search on the word &ldquo;linux-image&rdquo;.
</li>
<li>Look at the results carefully, and install the image marked upgradeable that has the word "mepis" attached and the next higher version number.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Such updates (only internal version number changes) can be installed without endangering the reboot process.  Kernel upgrades, where the major number changes will show up as a new package instead of an upgrade in Synaptic, should be approached with caution. They can be problematic, and may require manual editing of GRUB (see Wiki).</p>
<p>To solve particular problems, advanced users sometimes make use of <strong>kernel patches</strong>.  A patch is program that updates files according to instructions contained in a separate file, called a patch file. The patch file consists of a list of differences that can be run to change the original file. For details, follow the Wiki link below.</p>
<p>Advanced users sometimes compile and install their own kernel, starting with the kernel source code.  The motivation for doing this can range from pure fun to practical goals such as to produce a kernel optimized for a certain architecture and use.  Although the procedure is complicated, detailed directions can be found in the MEPIS Wiki if needed.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-5_headers">Kernel headers</h2>
<p>In order to compile some programs you might need to have kernel headers, which are C files that define structures and constants that are needed for building most standard programs. Some programs ask for kernel sources, but most often the headers are sufficient.  You can find them in Synaptic, but you have to be careful to match the headers to your kernel version.  For this reason, it is actually somewhat easier to open a terminal, become root, and type:</p>
<pre> apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)</pre>
<p>This code will enter automatically the number of your working kernel and fetch the appropriate headers.</p>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s10-5_panic">Kernel panic and recovery</h2>

<p>A kernel panic is a relatively rare action taken by the MEPIS Linux system when it detects an internal fatal error from which it cannot safely recover.  It can be caused by a number of different factors that range from hardware problems to a bug in the system itself.  When you get a kernel panic, try rebooting with the MEPIS Linux LiveCD, which will overcome temporarily any software problems and hopefully allow you to see and offload your data.  If that doesn't work, then unplug all unnecessary hardware and try again.</p>

<p>Your first concern is to access and secure your data.  Hopefully, you have it backed up somewhere.  If not, you can use one of the data recovery programs such as <strong>testdisk</strong> or <strong>ddrescue</strong> that are supplied with MEPIS Linux 8.0 (details in the Wiki).  Your last resort is to take your harddrive to a professional recovery business.</p>
<p>There are a number of steps you might have to take to recover a functional MEPIS Linux system once you have your data safe, although ultimately you may have to reinstall using the LiveCD.  Depending on the type of failure, the following steps may be undertaken:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remove packages that broke the system.</li>
<li>Reinstall the X config file.</li>
<li>Reinstall GRUB.</li>
<li>Reset the root password.</li>
<li>Reinstall MEPIS.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to ask on the MepisLovers.org forum if you have any questions about these procedures.</p>

<h2>MEPIS Community website</h2>
<p>Built and maintained by members of the MEPIS community, this website has links to nearly all aspects of MEPIS Linux online. Designed to be the primary bookmark for the MEPIS Linux user, it contains not only links to other MEPIS-related websites, but up-to-date news on MEPIS Community Projects &mdash;such as the Community Software Repository and the MEPIS Torrent Team&mdash; that are available nowhere else.  Available in six languages. </p>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s11-1_wiki">Wiki</h2>
<p>The MEPIS Wiki contains a great deal of other material.  As an ongoing product of volunteer users, it can be more up-to-date and detailed than the Manual.  Here's how to find what you're looking for:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Follow the structure by drilling down in the four areas laid out on the Main Page:
<ul> <!--sublist 1 -->
<li><u>Getting Started</u>: intended to provide new MEPIS users with the basic tools to get their system up and running.</li>
<li><u>General Knowledge Database</u>: intended to provide users with more advanced tools to understand and use their MEPIS system.</li>
<li><u>Help and Guides</u>: self-explanatory title, there is great stuff here for MEPIS users.</li>
<li><u>Wiki Issues</u>: topics pertaining to the Wiki itself.</li>
</ul></li>  <!--end sublist 1 -->

<li>Consult Special Pages: 
 <ul> <!-- sublist 2 -->
 <li>Click on the <strong>Wiki Categories</strong> link in the left panel, and select your topic of interest.  This is a very useful but often overlooked way to find answers to your questions.

</ol>


<br /><br />

<h2 id="s11-1_forums">Forums</h2>
<p>MEPIS Linux 8.0 users have a number of forums at their disposal:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>MepisLovers.org:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A friendly community forum for every level of knowledge, from newbie to expert.
</li>
<li><strong>MEPIS forums in other languages:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> MEPISIMO  Spanish forum, MEPIS France, and MEPISItalia
</li>
<li><strong>LinuxQuestions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A venerable Linux forum that has a section dedicated to MEPIS.
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the Links and Guides section at the bottom of the page for all the above.</p>
<h3>Forum protocol</h3>
<p>To get the answer you are seeking on any of these forums, please try to follow these procedures:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Do some research</u> on your own, reading the Wiki and using the search engines.
</li>
<li><u>Use meaningful, specific subject headers</u> so people know what you are talking about.  &ldquo;PLEASE HELP ME&rdquo; is not going to
get you much attention, whereas &ldquo;MEPIS 7 problems with HP scanner&rdquo; is much more likely to attract people who can help.
</li>
<li><u>Describe carefully</u> your hardware (see Section 5.1) and the sequence of actions that led to the problem(s).
</li>
<li><u>Remain courteous</u>: these forums are staffed by volunteers who give of their time, knowledge, and expertise for the sole reason of
wanting to help--the simple words "thank you" can do wonders.
</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h2 id="s11-1_search">Search engines</h2>
<p>A number of search engines can be used for more help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wiki</strong> search engines:
 
<ul> <!--sublist 1 -->
<li><u>Basic search</u>: type what you are looking for into the search box in the left panel and hit return.
</li>
<li><u>Detailed search</u>: click on the Custom search lin in the left panel.  This will take you to page powered by a custom Google search
that will search the entire Wiki for whatever you enter.
</li>
</ul></li> <!-- end sublist 1 -->

<li><strong>Mepis.org</strong> search engine -- good tool that gives you access to all the older discussions and announcements published on the main MEPIS site.  Be careful that the information you find applies to your version of MEPIS.
</li>
<li><strong>MepisLovers.org</strong> search engine -- another good tool on this community site.
</li>
<li><strong>Google</strong> or another universal search engine -- you need to be careful about suitability of results, but these can be
particularly useful for tracking down drivers, error messages, hardware specs, etc.
</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: much of the Linux documentation on the web is out-of-date or unsuitable for MEPIS Linux 8.0, and could actually do more
harm than good to your system! Ask on the MepisLovers forum, if you are not certain whether or not an internet tip is applicable to
MEPIS 8.0.</p>

<h1 id="section12-1">12:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glossary of common terms </h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Linux terms can be confusing and offputting at first, so this Glossary provides a list of the ones used in this Manual to get you started. For more help on the terms used in the Linux computer world, see Links and Guides.</p>

<p>If you reached this page by clicking on a <span class="spterm" title="This is green, and if ye didn't ken green, 'twould define it for ye.">green</span> glossary link, use your browser's <strong> [&#060;&mdash;]&nbsp;&nbsp; back button</strong>  to return you to your previous page. </p>

<br /><br />

<h2>Terms</h2>
<p id="s12-1_backend"><strong>backend:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>back-end.</em>  The backend includes the various components of a program that process the user input entered through the frontend.  See also frontend.</p>

<p id="s12-1_backport"><strong>backport:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  Backports are new packages that have been recompiled to run on a released distribution in order to keep it up-to-date.</p>

<p id="s12-1_bash"><strong>BASH:</strong> The default shell on most Linux systems as well as on Mac OS X, BASH is an acronym for <em>Bourne-again shell.</em> For more information, see Links and Guides at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p id="s12-1_bittorrent"><strong>BitTorrent:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also<em> bit torrent</em> or <em>torrent.</em>  A method invented by Bram Cohen to distribute large files without the need for a single individual to provide the hardware, hosting and bandwidth resources required. </p>

<p id="s12-1_bootloader"><strong>Bootloader:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Program that initially chooses an operating system to load after the BIOS has finished intializing the hardware. Extremely small in size. the bootloader's only job is to hand contol of the computer over to the Operating System's kernel. Advanced bootloaders offer a menu to choose between several installed operating systems.  </p>

<p id="s12-1_bootoptions"><strong>Boot options:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  Also <em>cheat codes</em>.  Additional boot and kernel commands available to modify the boot and installation procedures. An example is &ldquo;vga=normal&rdquo; which tells the system to disable the default resolution, often used for older monitors.</p>

<p id="s12-1_chainloading">
<strong>chainloading:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>chain loading.</em> Instead of directly loading an operating system, a boot manager like GRUB can use chain loading to pass control from itself to a boot sector on a hard disk partition. The target boot sector is loaded in from disk (replacing the boot sector from which the boot manager itself was loaded) and the new boot  program is executed.  In addition to when it is necessary, as in booting Windows from GRUB, the advantage to chainloading is that each operating system on the hard disk drive &mdash;and there could be dozens&mdash; can be responsible for having the correct data in it's own boot sector. So GRUB residing in the MBR need not be rewritten every time there are any changes.  GRUB can simply chainload the relevant information from the boot sector of a given partition whether it has changed or remained the same since the last boot time.
</p>

<p id="s12-1_cloop"><strong>cloop error:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;  A failure to read a block of compressed data. <em>CLOOP</em>
is shorthand for <em>compressed loopback device</em>, a linux kernel module that allows a compressed filesystem to be read, such as is used on a MEPIS LiveCD.</p>

<p id="s12-1_cli"><strong>command line interface (CLI):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also known as <em>console, Konsole, terminal, command prompt, shell,</em> or <em>bash.</em> This is a UNIX-style text interface, which MS-DOS was also designed to resemble. A <em>root console</em> is one where administrative privileges have been acquired after entering the root password.</p>

<p id="s12-1_desktop-env"><strong>desktop environment:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The software which provides a graphical desktop (windows, icons, desktop, task bar, etc) for an operating system user. MEPIS integrates the KDE desktop and configures it to feel familiar to both Windows&#174; and Mac OS&nbsp;X&#174; users.</p>

<p id="s12-1_diskimage"><strong>disk image:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A file containing the complete contents and structure of a data storage medium or device such as a hard drive or DVD.  See also ISO.</p>

<p id="s12-1_distro"> <strong>Distribution:</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Linux Distribution, or &ldquo;distro&rdquo;, is a particular packaging of the Linux kernel with various GNU software packages, and  different desktops or window managers.  Since &mdash;unlike the proprietary code used in the Microsoft and Apple OS's&mdash; GNU/Linux is Free, Open-Source Software, literally anyone in the world who has the ability can freely build on what has been done and innovate a new vision of a GNU/Linux operating system. MEPIS Linux is a distro based on the Debian Linux family. </p>


<p id="s12-1_filesystem"><strong>file system:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also <em>filesystem.</em> This refers to the way that files and folders are logically arranged on a computer's storage devices so they may be found by the operating system. It can also refer to the type of formatting on a storage device, such as the common Windows formats NTFS and FAT32, or the Linux formats EXT3 or ReiserFS, and in this sense refers to the method actually used to encode binary data on the Hard Disk Drive, floppy, flash drive, etc.</p>

<p id="s12-1_free"><strong>free-as-in-speech:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> The English word &ldquo;free&rdquo; has two possible meanings: 1) without cost, and 2) without restrictions. In part of the open-source software community, an analogy used to explain the difference is 1) &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in beer vs. 2) &ldquo;free&rdquo; as in speech. The word <em>freeware</em> is used universally to refer to software that is simply without cost, whereas the phrase <em>free software</em> loosely refers to software that is more properly called open-source software, licensed under some type of open source license such as <a href="#s12-1_gpl" class="spterm" >the GPL.</a></p>

<p id="s12-1_frontend"><strong>frontend:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also <em>front-end</em>. The front-end is the part of a software system that interacts directly with the user. See also backend. </p>

<p id="s12-1_gpl"><strong>GPL:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The GNU General Public License. This is a license under which many open-source
applications are released. It specifies that you may view, modify, and redistribute the source code of applications released under it, within certain limits; but that you may not distribute the executable code unless you also distribute the source code to anyone who asks for it.</p>

<p id="s12-1_gui"><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> This refers to a program or operating system interface that uses pictures (icons, windows, etc), as opposed to text (command-line) interfaces.</p>

<p id="s12-1_home-dir"><strong>home directory:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>   One of the 17 top-level directories branching from the root directory in MEPIS Linux, <strong>/home</strong> contains a subdirectory for every registered user of the system. Within each user's home directory s/he has full read-write privileges.  Further, most of the user-specific configuration files for various installed programs are stored in hidden subdirectories within the /home/<em>username</em> directory &mdash;as is downloaded email. Other downloaded files usually go by default into the home/<em>username</em>/Documents or /home/<em>username</em>/Desktop subdirectories. </p>

<p  id="s12-1_iso"><strong>ISO:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A disc image following an international standard that contains data files and filesystem metadata, including boot code, structures, and attributes.  This is the normal method for delivering Linux versions such as MEPIS over the Internet. See also <em>disk image.</em></p>

<p id="s12-1_kernel"><strong>kernel:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The layer of software in an operating system that interacts directly with the hardware.</p>

<p id="s12-1_kicker"><strong>Kicker:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  The panel in KDE that appears by default at the bottom of the screen and contains navigation icons, open (minimized) programs and system notifications. It is highly configurable, and can include a utility to switch between any of several desktops you can run simultaneously, if your primary desktop surface tends to get cluttered with open programs. For a graphic and a short explanation of its default appearance, see <a href="index.html#s03-3_kicker"> Section 3.3: Kicker.</a></p>

<p id="s12-1_livecd"><strong>LiveCD:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A bootable compact disc from which one can run an operating system, usually with a complete desktop environment, applications, and essential hardware functionality. In 2003, MEPIS was the first distribution of Linux to include a GUI-based Installer application on the desktop of a fully functional LiveCD, so a separate Installation CD was no longer needed. Simultaneously, MEPIS was also the first Linux to include GUI-based tools, now called <em>Assistants,</em> on the LiveCD to help a user repair a broken system.</p>

<p id="s12-1_mbr"><strong>MBR:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> Master Boot Record: the first 512-byte sector of a bootable hard disk drive. Special data written to the MBR enables the computer's BIOS to pass the boot process off to a partition with an installed operating system.</p>

<p id="s12-1_md5sum"><strong>md5sum:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A program that calculates and verifies a file's data integrity. The MD5 hash (or checksum) functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file. It is extremely unlikely that any two non-identical files will have the same MD5 hash. Because almost any change to a file will cause its MD5 hash to also change, the MD5 hash is commonly used to verify the integrity of files.</p>

<p id="s12-1_mirror"><strong>mirror:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong> Also <em>mirror site.</em>  An exact copy of another Internet site, commonly used to provide multiple sources of the same information to supply  reliable access to large downloads. </p>

<p id="s12-1_module"><strong>module:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>   Modules are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system.</p>

<p id="s12-1_mountpoint"><strong>mountpoint:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The place on the root filesystem where a fixed or removable device is attached (mounted) and accessible as a subdirectory. All computer hardware needs to have a mountpoint in the filesystem to be usable. Most standard devices such as keyboard, monitor and your primary hard disk drive are mounted automatically at boot.</p>

<p id="s12-1_ntfs"><strong>NTFS&#174;:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>  Microsoft's New Technology File System  debuted in 1993 on the Windows NT Operating System, geared to business networks, and with revisions entered the mainstream Windows users' desktop computers in later versions of Windows 2000. It has been the standard file system since Windows XP was introduced in late 2001. Unix/Linux-oriented folk say it stands for "Nice Try File System."</p>

<p id="s12-1_opensource"><strong>open-source:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Software whose source code has been made available to the public under a license that allows individuals to modify and redistribute the source code. In some cases, open-source licenses restrict the distribution of binary executable code. For more information visit the Open Software Initiative (link below).</p>

<p id="s12-1_package"><strong>package:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A package is a discrete, non-executable bundle of data that includes instructions for your package manager about installation. A package  doesn't always contain a single application; it might contain only part of a large application, several small utilities, font data, graphics, or help files. </p>

<p id="s12-1_package-man"><strong>package manager:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A package manager such as (Synaptic or KPackage) is a collection of tools to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages. See <a href="index.html#section07-2 ">7.2: Synaptic Software Package Manager</a></p>

<p id="s12-1_port"><strong>port:&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>  A virtual data connection that can be used by programs to exchange data directly, instead of going through a file or other temporary storage location.  Ports have numbers assigned for specific protocols and applications, such as 80 for HTTP, 5190 for AIM, etc.</p>

<p id="s12-1_repo"><strong>repo:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> See <em>repository</em>. </p>

<p id="s12-1_repository"><strong>repository:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A software repository is an internet storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed via a <a href="index.html#s12-1_package-man" class="spterm" >package manager.</a>  In MEPIS Linux, the repository list file (<strong>/etc/apt.sources.list</strong>) is typically modified through the default package manager <em>Synaptic.</em> </p>

<p id="s12-1_rootfs"><strong>root&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Root has two common meanings in Unix/Linux OSs, and they are intimately connected, but the distinction is important to understand. The <strong>root <a href="#s12-1_filesystem"  class="spterm" >filesystem</a></strong> is the basic logical structure of all the files the operating system can access, whether programs, processes, pipes or data. It should follow the Unix Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, which specifies where in the hierarchy to locate all types of files. </p>
<p id="s12-1_rootuser">The second meaning of <strong>root</strong> is the computer <strong>user</strong> who owns the root filesystem &mdash;and so has all permissions necessary to do anything to any file. While it is sometimes necessary to temporarily assume the powers of the <strong><em>root user</em></strong> to install or configure programs, it is dangerous and violates the basic security structure of Unix/Linux to log in and operate as <em>root</em> unless absolutlely necessary. In a command line interface, a regular user can temporarily become root by issuing the command <strong>su</strong> then entering the root password.</p>

<p id="s12-1_runlevel"><strong>runlevel&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A runlevel is a preset operating state on a Unix-like operating system.  A system can be booted into any of several runlevels, each of which is represented by a single digit integer. Each runlevel designates a different system configuration and allows access to a different combination of processes (i.e., instances of executing programs). See <a href="index.html#section10-4 ">Section 10.4: Runlevels</a> </p>

<p id="s12-1_script"><strong>script:&nbsp;</strong> An executable text file, containing commands in an interpreted language. Usually refers to BASH scripts which are used extensively &ldquo;under the hood&rdquo; of the Linux operating system, but other languages may be used as well.</p>

<p id="s12-1_sourcecode"><strong>source code:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The human-readable code in which software is written prior to being assembled or compiled into machine-language code.</p>

<p id="s12-1_switch"><strong>switch:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>  A switch (also <em>flag</em>, <em>option</em> or <em>parameter</em>) is a modifier appended to a command to change its behavior.  A common example is <strong>-R</strong> (recursive), which tells the computer to carry out the command through all subdirectories.</p>

<p id="s12-1_symlink"><strong>symlink:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also symbolic link and soft link. A special type of file that points to another file or directory and not to data.  It allows the same file to have different names and/or locations.</p>

<p id="s12-1_tarball"><strong>tarball:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> An archiving format, like zip, popular on the Linux platform. Unlike zip files, though, tarballs may use one of a number of different compression formats, such as gzip or bzip2. They usually end in file extensions like .tgz, .tar.gz, or .tar.bz2. Many archive formats are supported in MEPIS with a graphical application called Ark. Usually an archive can be extracted simply by right-clicking on it in KDE.</p>

<p id="s12-1_window-man"><strong>window manager:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> A component of a desktop environment that provides the basic
maximize/minimize/close/move functions for windows in the GUI environment. Sometimes it can be used as an alternative to a full desktop environment. In MEPIS, the default window manager is called KWin, and is an integral part of the K Desktop Environment (KDE). In antiX, the default is Fluxbox,  a very light windows manager that requires very little graphics and system RAM.</p>

<p id="s12-1_unix"><strong>Unix:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>UNIX.</em> The operating system which Linux is modeled after, developed in the late 1960's at Bell Labs and used primarily for servers and mainframes. Like Linux, Unix has many variations. </p>

<p id="s12-1_x11"><strong>X:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Also <em>X11, xorg.</em> The X Window System is a networking and display protocol which provides windowing on bitmap displays. It provides the standard toolkit and protocol to build graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Unix-like operating systems and OpenVMS, and is supported by almost all other modern operating systems. In Mepis Linux, the X server operates on <a  class="spterm" href="index.html#s12-1_runlevel ">runlevel</a> 5. See also: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager ">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_display_manager</a>
